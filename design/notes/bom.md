## Bill of Materials

##### Physical

- Rules-only book
    - Strict rules text
    - Flavor, vibes, but not much setting _content_
    - Avoid too many “text layers” in here (flavor + GM guidance + rules +
       examples etc make it confusing)
- Tutorial
    - Step by step
    - Optimized for quickly jumping in
    - Examples/play examples
    - etc
- Setting book
    - Ideally in some way possible to remove individual bits to hand to the players
       somehow?
    - Universe:
       - Overarching concepts
       - Some example planets
       - Some example societies
       - In-world mythology
    - Content collections:
       - Social snippets
       - Tools
       - Weapons
       - Armor
       - Specimen
       - Base-related stuff
       - Group companion beast of burden
    - Spoiler Universe
       - Meta-layer
       - Creation reality
       - Underlying structures/rules

##### Digital files

- All illustrations from the books

##### Digital tools

- Player handout designer tool thingy (pick illustration or maybe a few, arrange, label,
    description)
- Rule oracle


- World generator
    - Prompted/finetuned LLM that can dream up more things on demand? (maybe
       even canon things? That would be wild. All tables/parties essentially being in
       a shared world. Would require a ton of thought though in terms of how to not
       make interactions terrible. And generally again make the world kina whacky I
       think)
    - Maybe even including illustrations (also finetuned imagegen)?
- Microtools
    - Syllable spell generator
       - Something something gen art creation animation/design
    - Specimen generator
    - Travel segment generator
    - Character sheet/tracker
    - Combat tracker
    - Etc
- Full assistant tool:
    - Ties together logic from microtools into full GM assistant
    - I/O options for hardware visualization/integration
    - E-Ink compatible design
    - Maybe once Claude is far enough along actually a GM itself, not just an
       assistant?
