# Teaching Tacit Knowledge


# Teaching Tacit Knowledge

_This is a framework for transferring tacit knowledge that I picked up from the founder of
JHourney (Stephen), which he adapted from this post (largely based on US DoD research). I
think this could be a powerful way to transmit research taste, which is famously tacit and
hard to teach, and I think it’s worth experimenting with this._

**Cues, Expectations, and Implications** is a framework for transferring tacit knowledge. The
core idea is that tacit knowledge is chiefly composed of:

1. **Cues** : Knowing what to look for.
2. **Expectations** : Knowing what those cues indicate about the world.
3. **Implications** : Knowing what those expectations imply about your next steps.

The reason these are hard to transfer in writing is that:

1. You learn what to look for and how to tie that into actions by seeing lots of examples.
    You may never have formulated or been taught a unified theory of the domain (one
    might not exist!).
2. Many of the steps and associations are subconscious / implicit. An expert researcher
    just knows that something feels off about a plot. If you ask them they might be able to
    tell you why, but usually what you witness is the expert _acting,_ not them telling you
    how the evidence becomes an action.

In the case of JHourney, apparently, training instructors / facilitators was a real bottleneck for
a long time. The way they overcame this is by having Stephen watch a recorded session of a
facilitator with a participant and speak out loud about (a) what he’s noticing as he watches,
(b) what that implies about the participant’s experience, and (c) how that translates into
action. They recorded Stephen reacting to the original recording, and then have facilitators
watch many such sessions.

Importantly:

1. This isn’t Stephen giving a presentation.
2. It’s not him doing a deep retrospective on a participant’s experience or the facilitator’s
    performance.
3. Rather, it’s him speaking off the cuff about the immediate things he’s noticing.

The reason this matters is that it forces him to make explicit the often-implicit cues he’s
picking up on, and tie those very explicitly to beliefs about the world and then actions based
on those beliefs.

According to Stephen, after adopting this approach facilitator training became relatively
straightforward and JHourney was able to scale a lot faster.

Hailmary crazy idea: Somehow get BLM to right after taping an episode go go through the
VOD and live voiceover the whole thing off the cuff
