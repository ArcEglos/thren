```
● There are three main categories of texts
○ Rules text
○ Out of world text descriptions
○ In-world text artifacts
```
**Rules text**

```
● Rules text is short, to the point and crisp
```
**Out of world text descriptions**

```
● Evocative, poetic and bold
● Rich in sensory detail
● Sentence length is varied to produce impactful pacing
● The goal is to anchor the reader in the world
● Presents a world not desperate to explain itself
● Things can be left open, mysterious and unexplained
● Depicts horrible, vile things as well as beautiful ones - and dares to let them stand on
their own without balancing them
```
**In-world text artifacts**

```
● Most of the out of world text descriptions also applies
● Deeply biased by the flawed authors
● Follows the traditions, viewpoints, formats and worldviews of the culture they
originated in
● But also shows these cultures as deeply internally conflicted and changing and
multi-facetted - nothing is ever simple or unanimous and disagreements are
everywhere.
```
**Names and linguistics**

```
● Most things from in-world text artifacts apply
● Be careful to not stereotype or appropriate cultural feel in ways that could be
insensitive
