## Inspiration

**IMPORTANT: This collection is just piles of stuff I find interesting or fascinating or
great. This doesn’t mean that all of this has ended up or ever will end up included in
Thren in the end. But I don’t want to throw away this list, as it’s a curated statement of
my tastes in and of itself.**

##### Unsolved

1. How to make the infinitely fractal layeredness and messiness of reality work. Three
    main problems:
       a. There are so many dimensions of messy that it’s really really hard to stay on
          top of things and on-the-fly be this layered
       b. Players still need to be able to have predictions/simulations of the world in
          their head that allows them to make decisions in a way where they feel like
          they have an idea of which decision would have which consequences -
          otherwise they don’t feel like they have agency. Multiple options for this:
             i. Make things more similar to the real world (booring)
ii. Make things simpler (less layered and nuanced and can feel synthetic
and flat)
iii. Be very precise about the places of layering: (probably the best, but
very hard to pull of well)
1. Put lots of textures into aspects that are not part of the
causality-web of the game
2. Make the aspects that _are_ critical to the game causality
either very explicit and actively teach it to the players or make
it simpler/closer to the real world and hope that the layering
and texture carries you
       c. If your stories are supposed to have a point and themes and put a lens on
          something specific and generally be dramatic and sculptural - you want to
          retain some amount of focus and not become too cluttery and chaotic. The
          real world is not very cinematic or sculptural, in many ways because it is so
          messy and denies any attempts at a coherent interpretation. That’s kinda
          exhausting - not a great game. So lived-in yes, but still with intention.
2. Redteaming!
    a. We should run active redteaming to plug system-holes (magic breaking
       societies, etc)
3. If magic is real in this world - which it is - how does technological progress of said
    magic work? It will exist! Let’s not do a medieval stasis thing. Let’s instead figure out
    how to make magical-understanding improvements over time part of societies, it’s
    conflicts, etc
       a. This doesn’t have to mean that people understand how magic works! Maybe
          it’s still a pretty new phenomenon somehow? Or maybe it’s just wildly hard to
          understand because of some path-dependence - or actually, more likely
          because the required machinery for making experiments and measurements
          isn’t developed enough yet? Bottom line is: It can still be extremely
          mysterious and “soft” - the progression and change is the important bit


```
b. Also I do kinda dig the idea of magic actually being very new and this
somehow explaining why society hasn’t fully adapted to it yet etc
c. Oh also one type of progress in this space might be that slowly some folks
are figuring out how to produce predictable repeatable on-demand spells. But
it’s super early and super expensive and only suuuper few are known. And
there is this fun tension between the magic practitioners and the new
“industrialized” way of doing arcane things and <insert massive societal
change and conlifct here>
```

○ Comment:
■ Many modern fantasy authors come from secular or post-Christian
contexts. They don’t personally know what it’s like to have every
choice—diet, marriage, work, travel—filtered through a religious lens. So
when they write “medieval” characters, they accidentally project modern,
secular psychology back onto them. Faith becomes an option, not a
default. Worldbuilders usually design religions as lore (gods, myths,
rituals, symbols), but not as something that actively shapes how
characters live. The result: gods are namedropped, temples exist, but
characters act like 21st-century people with occasional superstitious
seasoning.

Flux Planet-Specific Variations

Different world types emphasize different Flux aspects:

**Void-edge worlds** : Peak might open temporary portals **Water worlds** : Flux dramatically
affects tides and currents **Living planets** : The planet-being's mood follows Flux cycles **Dead
worlds** : Might briefly spark to life during Peak **Garden worlds** : Specimen availability heavily
Flux-dependent


##### Specific rules snippets I like:

```
● I know a guy
● Afflictions (his majesty the worm, p.97/98)
● Shared inventory/vehicle/something like that that is collaboratively managed (the last
caravan, wildsea)
● Clocks/tracks/downtime tracks in general (the last caravan,wildsea, daggerheart, his
majsty the worm)
● Items/things are temporary and/or break - makes it a lot easier to give out powerful
toys, if they are not around forever (his majesty the worm)
○ Just watch out they don't hoard all the good things and don't dare to use them
(maybe more strict inventory limits or something?)
● Fear/hope as self-balancing action economy & turn determinant (daggerheart)
● A character flaw causing a complication gives that player a resource (heroism in the
last caravan)
○ Makes it easier for monkeybrain to gleefully make the character jump into the
blender for the stories' sake
● PC death from Daggerheart
● Loadout change during rest, but also at any time for a price from daggerheart
● From mythic bastionland:
○ Your base stats are things that constantly fluctuate based on how you're
feeling (e.g. a failed check to climb a tree might be a hit to your physical
strength because now you're winded or bruised or something)
○ Guard
○ Feats
○ Gambits
○ Seasonality, passing time & ages
● Players being asked to do ceremonial things on the table (Seven-part Pact end of a -
I think - season procedure)
● Everything on encounter design from silent titans p 8-
● Difficulty or cost to craft based on number of syllables in description (his majesty the
worm commission craft p. 158)
● The group doesn’t have money, just “poor”, “ok”, “well-off”, “rich” (the rest is handled
by the inventory system
```

Running the game

##### Special capability pool

```
● [META]: Various things that are currently “Take Strain” rules could also be abilities
(still costing strain, or being otherwise limited)
● Infuse spell creation with custom intent
● Find a species that you can in-the-moment interact with in some way to solve your
problem
```

```
● Push your current transport to go faster than normally possible
● Overload transport capacity temporarily
● A member of the troupe gets emergency-moved by e.g. a branch suddenly appearing
● Find a useful bit of background information about a faction or person
● When your hit succeeds, you get to make another one
● You can take a Mind Strain to go into social debt. Create a -1 connection (you now
owe them) (or even more negative for bigger favors - if you dare). They'll help now
but expect repayment. The GM roleplays the negotiation, making clear through the
NPC's demeanor and demands how serious this debt will be.
● Flux related:
○ Arcanist : Maintain one spell through phase changes
○ Symbiologist: If you have a recipe for your creating, get x bonus
○ Symbiologist : One specimen ignores Falling degradation
```
##### Items

```
● A salve that makes you recover more Body strain than usual, but:
○ If you roll a 1 you’re now permanently desensitized to it
○ If you roll a 1 you take a mind strain instead
○ ...
```
