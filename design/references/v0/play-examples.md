#### Navigation/travel: Crossing the Spawning Grounds

_The party needs to cross the Driftseed Plains during spawning season to reach the archive
city. GM creates a 5-segment track._

**Segment 1: The Approach** "The plains ahead pulse with movement. Millions of seedpods
lift and fall in waves."

GM: "Two routes through the spawning grounds:"

```
● A) Follow the Harvester Paths - Well-worn but longer (2 track progress, automatic)
● B) Cut through the active spawning area - Risky but direct (3 track progress,
requires roll)
```
Party chooses B.

**Who can help?**

```
● Torrnek: "I'll use Symbiosis - I know these plants from my inadequacy working the
seed farms"
● Kemerin: "I'll assist with Study - I read about their spawning patterns"
● Sethrem warrior: "Can't help here, saving myself for trouble"
```
Roll: Success! The party times their movement between spawning waves. 3 segments
complete.

**Segment 2: Complication!** "A predator-swarm has been following you, waiting for you to
disturb the seeds."

**Choices:**

```
● A) Outrun them - Physical check, 1 progress but everyone takes strain if failed
● B) Distract with specimens - Symbiosis to release pheromone specimen, 1
progress, lose specimen
● C) Hide until they pass - Physical (stealth approach), no progress but safe
```
Party chooses A. The warrior takes lead with Physical 3, others assist. Roll includes
momentum die - success but momentum shifts!

GM: "You outpace the swarm but stumble into a Tangle Grove - the vines here think you're
fleeing prey."

**Segment 3: The Tangle Grove** Now it's dangerous. The GM spends a fear token.

"The grove is hungry. Thorned vines descend from above."


**Forced challenge:** Must escape the grove

```
● Warrior uses Physical (Force approach) to hack through
● Scholar uses Weave to throw syllables to confuse the plants
● Roll both, need at least one success
```
Both succeed! The Weave success adds unexpected benefit: "The syllables make the vines
bloom prematurely, creating a perfumed path. +1 track progress as bonus."

**Final arrival:** Track complete! "You emerge at the archive city's root-gates, covered in pollen
and thorn-scratches but alive."

#### Dual sided Track: Void Poisoning

(5 segments)

Onset→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→Death

```
Nausea Paralysis
```
**Turn 1** : Poison advances to segment 2 (Nausea). Party rolls Symbiosis to find antidote -
success! Fill "Death" segment from right:

Onset→[X]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 2** : Poison advances to segment 3. Party succeeds again, fill "segment 5":

Onset→[X]→[X]→[ ]→[▓]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 3** : Poison advances to segment 4 (Paralysis) but can't go further. Success now
reverses:

Onset→[X]→[X]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 4** : Another success, reverse to segment 2:

Onset→[X]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→Death
