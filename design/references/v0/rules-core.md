# Basic Rules


## Welcome

You are a group of Sethrem. Each of you an individuum formed by a Kemerin and a Torrnek
bonding.
This world is not kind. You are not invincible. Sometimes the only thing you can do is run.

## Basic rules

##### Dice pools

When asked to roll a Dicepool(n), roll n d6 and take the highest number. A 4-5 is a result
with some complication, a 6 is a full success. 1-3 is a failure. Unless specified otherwise.
If n = 0, roll 2d6 and take the lowest, for n=-1 roll 3d6 take lowest, etc.
For any dicepool roll the GM can also add an additional modifier on the amount of dice
depending on the situation.

##### Duality

How the body-side - the Torrnek - and the mind-side - the Kemerin - are interacting is core to
your character.

#### Abilities

You have a collection of capabilities that are unique to you. They give you access to skills
and modify the rules that apply to you in some way.

#### Skills

When you take an action that is neither easy nor impossible for you, you use a skill to
determine the result. There are five skills:

```
● Socialize (Mind-side): Convince, lie, negotiate, misdirect, inspire, hide intentions,
build trust
● Study (Mind-side): Research, recall facts, analyze, use references
● Physically act (Body-side): Fight, lift, sneak, climb, break, quick reflexes, push
through
● Symbiosis (Body-side): Biological crafting, specimen combination, creature handling
● Weave (Both-sides): Create spells, throw syllables, read patterns
```
You get access to these skills based on your abilities. If you don’t have access to a skill you
normally can’t do the associated actions. If you’re desperate enough you might attempt an
improvised skill check.


##### Observation

Everyone can observe, regardless of skills. Roll a Dicepool(2 - Strain + Collaborator). Others
can collaborate if they have any knowledge of the skill, each collaborator adds a die to the
pool.

##### Improvised skill check

For unusual situations (e.g., "cooking alien soup") where skills don’t apply:

1. GM describes the challenge
2. Player explains their approach using their character background/capabilities
3. Determine dicepool size:
    ○ difficulty vs character match (excellent match for something easy: six dice,
       desperate attempt on something really hard: zero dice)
    ○ applicable strain
    ○ 1 dice extra for each character collaborating if reasonable for the task
4. Roll
5. One die has a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

#### Strain

You don’t lose hitpoints, you accumulate Body Strain and Mind Strain. If you get
overwhelmed you shut down or risk - partial - death.

#### Rest

Getting a full rest takes 8 hours. If you don’t get a rest for more than 24h you’re risking
strain.

#### Momentum

In action scenes, momentum flows between GM and the players. It is determined by
momentum checks depending on the skill used.

When a momentum check would fail, you can:

1. Maintain control
    a. Take 2 Strain (Mind of Body, depending on action)
    b. Keep momentum on your side
2. Accept the shift. The GM chooses ONE:
    a. **Immediate Turn** : GM acts right after your action resolves
    b. **Bank Fear Token** : Store for later escalation
    c. **Complication** : Something in the scene gets worse for you

##### Inadequacy


You have an inadequacy that is impacting you and can ruin things in the worst moments. For
example:

- Regret: You’re haunted by something you did (or didn’t) do
- Recklessness: Sometimes you ignore your - or others’ - safety in pursuit of your goal
- Fear: If you think about it too much you get overwhelmed
- Blame: There’s someone responsible for all the bad that’s happened to you

When you act on your inadequacy in a way that causes complications, you clear one strain.

#### Create your character

Pick 10 Abilities. Write your character profile and decide on your inadequacy. Pick if you’re a
youth, adult or mature.


# Strain


## Strain

#### Strain

You don’t lose hitpoints, you accumulate Body Strain and Mind Strain. If you get
overwhelmed you shut down or risk - partial - death.

##### Accumulating

**Voluntarily:** As the least bad option in bad situations, you can take strain to solve an
immediate problem
**Involuntarily:** Getting hurt, experiencing terrible things or being exhausted can cause strain

##### Recovery

Clear two Strain on each Rest.
Medical remedies and Abilities can clear additional Strain.

##### Limits

Your default limit for both body and mind strain is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

When you hit the limit on the Strain of one side, you have two options:

1. Strained side shuts down
2. Desperate push - roll 1d6 immediately:
    a. **1-3** : **Death** - that side of the bond dies
    b. **4-6** : Clear 4 Strain, continue functioning

##### Shutdown

You’re overwhelmed. Something inside you gives up. This will have lasting consequences.

**You take a Scar:** The Strain limit for the side shutting down is permanently reduced by 2.
Work with the GM to define the scar narratively.
Removing a scar is a major quest in itself.

Effects:

- **Body shutdown:** The Body becomes unresponsive while the Mind observes,
    terrified.
- **Mind shutdown:** The Mind goes catatonic while the Body continues, vaguely aware
    the party are friends.
- **Both sides shut down** : Complete catatonia

#### Adrenaline

The blood is pumping through your veins, you rolled your ankle and you didn’t even notice.


##### Hits

During dangerous scenes, the Body tracks physical damage as hits, separate from strain.
Any hits you receive first consume your Guard, then accumulate. As long as you stay below
your overwhelmed threshold you are not impaired. If you hit this threshold your adrenaline
immediately crashes.

Your default overwhelmed threshold is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

##### Crash

Once the dangerous scene is over - or you hit your overwhelm threshold - your adrenaline
crashes. Your actions catch up to you:

```
● Every hit converts to 1 Body strain
● Medical attention can reduce conversion
```
##### Guard

You start with 1 Guard. Abilities and Equipment can increase your Guard. It replenishes once
the dangerous scene is over.
