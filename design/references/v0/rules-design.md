# Rule Design Notes


## Design Notebook

**IMPORTANT: These notes were not always kept in sync when rules or systems were
changed/tweaked/iterated. So there are probably a bunch of outdated facts in here.
However, it’s probably still useful as a snapshot insight into how I was thinking about
what.**

#### Base skills setup

###### Why This Works

```
● Enforces symbiotic theme : Characters literally need each other
● Action multiplication : Collaboration creates more actions, not just enables them
● Meaningful specialization : Each rating tier serves distinct purpose
● Emergency valves : Strain allows pushing limits when desperate
● Clear party composition : Groups can identify and fill gaps
```
###### Open Questions for Playtesting

```
● Should masters (4) have limits on how many they can teach per scene?
● Should collaboration require specific positioning/range?
● How does skill progression work? (especially for long campaigns)
```
#### Study

###### Why These Choices

**Mental Loadout** : Represents cognitive limits. You can't hold everything in active memory.
Creates meaningful choices about what to prepare for.

**Physical references** : Knowledge has weight and takes space. Books can be lost.
Information is treasure worth protecting.

**Exhaustion over failure** : Research usually works but costs mental resources. Push too
hard and you start making things up.

**Source quality matters** : Not all information is equal. Better sources give better results, but
you work with what you have.

**Collaborative by default at low skill** : Research is hard. Most people need help to do it well.
Masters can work alone but still benefit from collaboration.


**Integration with strain** : Mental exhaustion ties to overall character fragility. Knowledge work
is real work with real costs.

### Open Questions

###### Mechanical Tuning

1. Should Mental Loadout size vary by skill or be fixed?
2. Is 3/5/7 exhaustion boxes appropriately scaled?
3. Should some topics be impossible without specific sources?
4. How many reference books can characters reasonably carry?

###### Integration Details

1. Can crafted items serve as reference sources?
2. Should social connections provide reference access?
3. Can navigation routes be researched without traveling them?
4. Do syllabic entities provide research bonuses?

###### Edge Cases

1. What if no one has Study skill?
2. Can references be copied or must they be originals?
3. Should some knowledge be dangerous to research?
4. How do language barriers affect research?

###### Campaign Scaling

1. Do references improve over campaign time?
2. Can characters create their own references?
3. Should legendary references exist with special properties?
4. How do cultural differences affect research interpretation?

### Play Examples

###### Basic Research Scene

"I need to know this creature's weakness."

```
● Loadout includes "Regional fauna"
● Reference: "Hunter's Bestiary" (Standard)
● Match: Good (creature is variant of known type)
● Method: Standard Research (1 exhaustion)
● Roll: 5 (success with insight)
● Result: "Vulnerable to salt, but this variant has developed partial resistance"
```

###### Desperate Research

"The planet-being is stirring! What will it do?"

```
● Loadout: Switching from "Trade routes" (1 strain)
● Reference: None available
● Match: No Source (Study 4 only)
● Method: Deep Dive (3 exhaustion total)
● Roll: 3 (failure)
● Result: Convincing but completely wrong prediction
```
###### Collaborative Research

Study 2 Symbiologist + Study 3 Student:

```
● Symbiologist provides specimen (Authoritative source)
● Student provides research expertise
● Split 2 exhaustion between them
● Both learn the discovered information
```
This system makes knowledge valuable, costly, and uncertain—perfect for a universe where
understanding comes through careful observation but even expertise has limits.

#### Physically Act

###### Why These Choices

**Single skill with approaches** : Reduces character sheet complexity while maintaining
tactical depth. Approaches create meaningful choices without tracking multiple numbers.

**Equipment as enabler** : Tools and weapons change what's possible rather than providing
numerical bonuses. Maintains focus on fiction over arithmetic.

**Universal resolution** : Combat and non-combat use identical mechanics. Learn once, apply
everywhere.

**Biological equipment** : Reinforces symbiotic themes. Your gear is alive and has needs.

**Strain over HP inflation** : Characters remain fragile throughout. A lucky hit from a weak
opponent still matters.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Combat flows quickly without special subsystems
● Physical tasks feel weighty and consequential
```

```
● Equipment choices matter narratively
● Collaboration occurs naturally
● Fragility persists regardless of advancement
```
#### Socialize

###### Why These Choices

**Pre-investment model** : Eliminates awkward mechanical interruption during roleplay. Social
capital becomes literal preparation—getting introductions, spreading rumors, calling in favors
happen before the scene.

**Network as physical resource** : The web of connections becomes a campaign artifact that
evolves over time. Watching it grow and shift creates emergent narrative.

**Chain spending as actual movement** : Favors ripple through the network, depleting
multiple relationships. This makes intermediaries matter and creates natural limitations.

**Connection types with properties** : Different approaches create different risks and rewards.
Quick dirty connections offer power but instability. Patient honest building creates lasting
resources.

**Numerical decay** : Clear bookkeeping that creates campaign rhythm. Seasonal maintenance
becomes strategically important without overwhelming complexity.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Social encounters flow naturally without mechanical interruption
● Preparation becomes as important as execution
● Networks feel alive with finite, depleting resources
● Different social strategies have long-term consequences
● Information (snippets) becomes tradeable currency
● Going into debt creates future complications
● The most connected character isn't necessarily the one with the highest Social skill
```
###### Tone and Impact

The system emphasizes that relationships require investment and maintenance. Power
comes from what you've built and preserved, not just natural charisma. The network
physically shifting as it's used creates visible consequences for social manipulation. Every
favor called in, every lie told, every debt incurred leaves marks on the web of connections
that define the campaign's social landscape.


#### Crafting

###### Example

**Challenge** : Cross a chasm

**Using** :

```
● Voidwhisper Sap [adhesive] [weightless]
● Iron Seedpods [explosive-growth] [magnetic]
```
**Connections** :

1. [adhesive] bonds to cliff (conservative, 4+)
2. [explosive-growth] extends bridge (creative, 5+)
3. [weightless] prevents collapse (creative, 5+)

**Roll** : 4, 3, 6

```
● Adhesive works
● Growth fails
● Weightless critically succeeds
```
**Result** : "A floating but short bridge - you'll need to jump the last few feet"

###### Why This Works

**Reinforces Core Themes** :

```
● Technology through symbiosis, not manufacture
● Discovery through observation
● Nothing is permanent or guaranteed
● Collaboration enhances capability
```
**Creates Interesting Decisions** :

```
● Limited grid space forces tough choices
● Tag declaration requires planning
● Connection explanations reward creativity
● Maintenance adds ongoing cost
```
**Integrates With Other Systems** :

```
● Research reveals specimen properties
● Navigation determines available specimens
● Social connections might provide rare specimens
● Strain flows through as universal currency
```
**Supports Documentary Tone** :


```
● Daily collection routines like field researchers
● Specimens degrade and change
● Hypothesis testing through dice
● Knowledge grows through study
```
### Open Questions

###### Mechanical Tuning

1. **Grid size** : Is 5x4 right? Should it scale with creature size?
2. **Track lengths** : How many segments for typical projects?
3. **Specimen stacking** : Can you carry multiples of same specimen?
4. **Shape variety** : How many distinct shapes? Random or type-based?

###### Integration Points

1. **Multiple crafters** : Can several Symbiosis users collaborate on one project?
2. **Failed projects** : Do tracks reset, regress, or branch?
3. **Companion preferences** : Should creatures refuse certain specimen types?
4. **Tag limits** : Maximum tags per specimen? Can all be used at once?

###### Edge Cases

1. **Emergency crafting without specimens** : Any fallback options?
2. **Specimen trading** : How does this work with personal grids?
3. **Permanent creations** : Can anything be made to last indefinitely?
4. **Dangerous specimens** : Should some have storage risks?

###### Campaign Evolution

1. **Advanced specimens** : How do late-game materials differ?
2. **Legendary specimens** : Single-use game-changers?
3. **Specimen cultivation** : Can players grow their own?
4. **Cross-world specimens** : Special properties from void travel?

### Why These Design Choices

**Tag-based rather than mechanical properties** : Allows creative interpretation while
maintaining structure. Players narrate their scientific discovery.

**Grid tetris over slots** : Visual, tactile, creates natural limits without bookkeeping. Makes
storage an active puzzle.

**Abundance words over numbers** : More flexible, reduces tracking, feels organic.

**Morning declaration** : Creates planning phase, makes exploration intentional, establishes
daily rhythm.


**Connection-based resolution** : Rewards creative thinking over having "correct" ingredients.
Makes combination an act of discovery.

**First die momentum** : Ties risk directly to approach. Conservative = safe, wild = dangerous.

**Research reveals tags** : Creates synergy between subsystems, knowledge has mechanical
benefit.

**Maintenance rolls** : Nothing is permanent, creates ongoing engagement with specimens,
reinforces living nature.

The system aims to make crafting feel like biological field research rather than mechanical
assembly, supporting the setting's themes while creating engaging gameplay decisions at
every step.

#### Flux

### Design Philosophy

###### Why These Choices

**Affects biological/energetic systems only** : Keeps focus on the "living universe" theme.
Physical and social actions remain constant while the world changes around them.

**Predictable with exceptions** : Players can plan strategically, but cosmic events create
surprises that prevent perfect optimization.

**Risk/reward scaling** : Each phase offers opportunities and dangers. No phase is strictly
"better"—each serves different purposes.

**Strategic timing** : The Flux transforms "when" into as important a decision as "how." This
supports the documentary tone—observers must understand natural rhythms.

**Simple mechanical changes** : Each system has one or two knobs that Flux adjusts (affinity,
exposure, preservation) rather than completely different rules.

**Multi-world complexity** : Advanced play involves tracking multiple Flux cycles, creating rich
strategic depth without rules complexity.

### Strategic Implications

The Flux creates meaningful timing decisions:

###### Journey Planning

"Do we travel now during Calm (safe but expensive) or wait for Rising (risky but fast)?"


###### Resource Management

"Peak is coming—should we attempt that impossible craft or preserve our specimens?"

###### Risk Assessment

"We're entering Falling—do we push through with strain or wait for the next Calm?"

###### Multi-World Coordination

"The archive world is entering Calm (perfect for research) while the harvest world hits Rising
(ideal for specimen collection)"

### Play Examples

###### Strategic Decision

"The void-swimmer route opens during Peak, cutting travel time from 12 days to 3. But we'll
take double Exposure and our navigator is already struggling. Do we wait for Rising (safer
but 6 days) or push through?"

###### Phase Optimization

"We need to craft the antidote, but we're in Falling—all connections are harder. If we wait 2
days for Calm, preservation is perfect but the patient might not survive. Take the risk or
wait?"

###### Multi-World Planning

"The library world enters Calm tomorrow (perfect for research), but the breeding grounds hit
Peak tonight (rare specimens available). Split the party or miss an opportunity?"

This system makes the universe feel alive and breathing, where timing and adaptation
matter as much as skill and resources.

#### Strain, Momentum, Adrenalin, Guard

### Design Notes

**~40-50% chance of momentum shifting** regardless of success/failure

This system ensures:

```
● Constant tension : Success doesn't mean safety
```

```
● Player agency : Choose when to push vs. accept consequences
● Resource management : Strain becomes strategic currency
● Pacing control : GM always has potential to intervene
● Subsystem identity : Each resolution feels mechanically distinct
```
### Play Examples

**Physical Combat** : "I rolled 4, 5, 6, 2 - that's a success! But wait, that 2 means momentum
shifts?" "Yeah, unless you want to take Body strain to maintain control." "It's early in the
fight... I'll take the strain."

**Social Negotiation** : "The merchant agrees to your terms. Flip for momentum... Heads. The
GM gets a turn." "Actually, I'll take Mind strain to keep control - we need this deal clean."

**Spell Casting** : "Your spell works perfectly, but two syllables landed writing-side down.
Momentum shifts." "Let it shift. I can't afford more Mind strain right now."

**Research** : "You find the answer! But you drew the Jack of Spades. That's a black suit." "GM,
take your Fear token. I'm saving my strain for later."

### The Scar Spiral

Multiple scars create cascading fragility:

```
● First scar: Limit 5→4 (dangerous but manageable)
● Second scar: Limit 4→3 (every session becomes risky)
● Third scar: Limit 3→2 (death looms constantly)
● Fourth scar: Limit 2→1 (essentially unplayable)
```
This forces characters toward retirement or desperate quests for healing.

### Design Philosophy

###### Why These Choices

**Scars over simple death** : Creates lasting consequences that accumulate over a campaign.
Characters become marked by their experiences.

**Desperate push** : Provides player agency in critical moments. They choose their fate rather
than being subject to dice alone.

**Grieving over elimination** : Death creates story rather than ending it. The party must care
for their wounded companion.

**Gradual rebonding** : New bonds become character development rather than mechanical
necessity.


**The death spiral** : Intentionally creates pressure toward retirement or legendary healing
quests. Not all stories end in glory.

**Flaw rewards** : Players want their characters to fail interestingly. The mechanical reward
aligns with dramatic storytelling.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Every dangerous situation carries genuine threat
● Failure creates problems to solve, not characters to replace
● Death becomes meaningful and rare
● Long campaigns see characters accumulate history
● The Vostrani dual nature becomes mechanically essential
● Party bonds strengthen through shared trauma
```
###### Tone and Feel

This system supports the documentary tone of Thren—nature doesn't care about fairness,
but survival creates profound bonds between those who endure together. Characters who
survive multiple adventures together will bear the scars of their journey, creating a living
history of the campaign.

#### Further systems

### Design Notes

###### Why These Systems

**Titan Combat** : Creates tactical puzzles rather than HP races. Every massive entity
encounter becomes memorable through the telegraph pattern. Players feel clever for
interpreting signs and responding appropriately.

**Abstract Wealth** : Eliminates coin counting while preserving resource management through
the inventory system. Wealth becomes another fictional positioning element rather than
bookkeeping.

**Living Bases** : Reinforces symbiotic themes—even your home is a relationship to maintain.
Creates natural adventure hooks through base needs and moods.

**Seasonal rhythm** : Creates predictable maintenance beats without overwhelming
bookkeeping. Everything updates at once in a ritual fashion.

**Testimony-based progression** : Advancement emerges from actual play rather than XP
tracking. The stories you tell determine how you grow.


**Collective world-building** : Players shape the world through their actions and testimonies.
The campaign world evolves based on what happened.

**Retirement over death** : Characters complete their arcs and become part of the world's
fabric rather than simply dying.

###### The Ritual Experience

Season's end should feel like a meaningful pause:

```
● Light candles or change lighting
● Use formal language for testimonies
● Take turns without interruption
● Record major events in a campaign journal
● Celebrate growth and mourn losses
```
This ritualistic approach makes the mechanical bookkeeping feel like part of the story rather
than interrupting it.

###### Why Living equipment cycle

**No permanent loss** : Items return, removing the feel-bad of breaking favorite gear

**Anti-hoarding** : Can't save the bloom for the perfect moment—use it or it goes dormant
anyway

**Biological consistency** : Everything in Thren has cycles and needs

**Creates rhythm** : Equipment availability becomes another tactical consideration

**Narrative opportunities** : "We need to wake the ancient armor" becomes a quest

###### Integration

These systems support but don't complicate the core game:

```
● Titan combat uses existing Physical and strain systems
● Wealth works with the specimen inventory grid
● Bases tie into specimen gathering and social connections
```
Each adds flavor without adding complexity, maintaining focus on the core pillars of
symbiosis, exploration, and fragility.


#### Navigation using tracks and various skills

### Why This Works

```
● Different skills shine at different moments - not just "the navigator does
everything"
● Meaningful choices with risk/reward rather than just "pick the safe path"
● Collaborative by default - multiple party members contribute
● Complications feel natural - momentum shifts create logical problems
● The world feels alive - spawning seasons, predator behavior, hungry groves
```
