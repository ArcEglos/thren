## Items & Equipment

#### Companion

You and the group have a shared companion creature. It carries your effects while you’re on
the road, functioning as your inventory.

It has a maximum amount of things it can carry and can take Strain, too. It may also have
capabilities that influence how it can move, how much it can carry, and what its needs are.
Generally these creatures are just intelligent enough to follow simple instructions such as
waiting on the group somewhere, helping to watch out for danger or moving in specified
ways.

The group can have multiple companions, but can only take one of them with you at a time.

#### Equipment

Special equipment in Thren isn't manufactured—it's cultivated, befriended, or harvested from
creatures.

**Basic equipment** without special properties - simple weapons, tools, armor - never
degrade.
**Living equipment** - with special abilities/effects - has an active/dormant cycle. When
dormant, it loses its special properties.

**Example cycles:**

```
● Single Bloom : "This void-swimmer spine can pierce any armor... once per season"
● Flux Sensitive : "These navigator moths only wake during Peak Flux"
● Feed to Wake : "The armor sleeps unless fed rare specimens"
● Exhaustion Cycle : "After three uses, needs a full season of rest"
```
#### Shopping

The party shares a level of wealth. You can afford to buy anything that matches your level of
wealth - assuming it is available.
