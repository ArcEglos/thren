# Circle of Life


## Circle of Life

#### Passing of Time

At the end of a session, the table can decide that a Season or a Generation passes.

##### Season

The ritual of a passing season reflects on what happened and how it influences the future.

1: The Telling

The table together narrates the remaining events of the season. The group gathers
Specimen and social connections as appropriate.

**You gain a new Ability. If it’s the end of a year you also gain a new Skillpoint.**

2: The Reckoning

**Social Decay**

```
● Clean connections lose 1 point (minimum 0)
● Pressured connections lose 2 points (flip negative at 0)
● Dirty connections roll d6: 1-2 = exposed and flip negative
● Players narrate how neglected relationships withered
```
**Specimen Degradation**

```
● All specimens degrade one category (unless perfectly preserved)
```
**Equipment cycles**

```
● Dormant items check for reawakening
● Active items check for dormancy
```
**Base Seasonal Needs**

```
● Feeding requirement : 3-5 specimens of appropriate type
● Mood check : Roll d6
○ 1-2: Discontent (one capability dormant next season)
○ 3-4: Neutral (functions normally)
○ 5-6: Thriving (temporary bonus capability)
● If it’s the end of a year: Add a capability
● Describe how the base has grown/changed
```
3: The Turning


At the beginning of the next session, the GM introduces how the world changed:

```
● The current state of the Flux
● Major NPC plans advance or conclude
● Political situations shift
● New opportunities or threats emerge
● Travel routes move
● Seasonal events begin (migrations, blooms, dormancies)
```
##### Generation

**Social connections:** The table together narrates how the groups connections interact with
the world at large, completely changing their social network

**Specimen Degradation:** All specimens that are not perfectly preserved are gone and
replaced with a similar amount and quality of completely different specimen

**Skill progression:**

```
● You may swap out abilities to different ones you have learned in the intervening time
● You may redistribute 3 skill points (but cannot reduce anything below 1)
```
**Base evolution:** The table together narrates how the base interacts with the world at large
and evolves over time, completely changing it.

Aging

You age one bracket. Describe the physical changes. Your capabilities change with you:

```
● Youth → Adult: Gain 1 to any skill
● Adult → Mature: +1 Mind limit, -1 Body limit
● Mature → Elder: +1 to knowledge, -1 to all Body-involving skills, consider retirement
```
#### Retirement

When characters reach narrative completion or become too scarred/aged:

**The Retirement Ceremony** :

1. Player narrates their character's final testimony
2. Character becomes NPC, remaining in the world
3. They might provide knowledge, shelter, or quests

#### Death

You are broken. Half of you died, with you feeling every moment of it.


##### Grief

Grieving takes time. You are playing as an unbonded Torrnek or Kemerin while you are
grieving. Discuss with the GM how long it will last. Some Broken-bonded never bond again
and choose retirement.

You lose all skills of the side that died. The remaining skills are reduced by one from the
trauma. Adjust your character and inadequacy.

**Torrnek:**

- Operates on habit and instinct
- Recognizes party as "safe" but may not remember why
- Can fight, build, and work but cannot strategize
- Must be given clear, simple directions
- May wander off if not watched

**Kemerin:**

- Requires care from party (food, warmth, safety)
- Physically helpless (size of a housecat)
- Can cling to party members for transport
- Can observe, speak, and advise

##### Rebonding

When rebonding after grief, distribute 3 skill points across any Skills.
Your new bond partner brings their own background and connections - adjust name,
character and inadequacy


# Base of Operations


## Base of Operations

A place to call home - not built but _cultivated_. Bases are typically massive sedentary
organisms or grown structures that require care and feeding.

The party needs to be at least well-off to start a Base.

#### Base Properties

**Size** : How many people it can shelter

```
● Small (the party)
● Medium (party + hirelings)
● Large (small community)
```
**Capability examples** (gained through feeding/cultivation):

```
● Storage : Extended inventory space, specimen preservation
● Defense : Natural barriers, warning systems
● Comfort : Reduces strain recovery time
● Workshop : Enables complex crafting projects
● Communications : Connection to travel-plants or message systems
● Concealment : Hidden from casual observation
```
#### Maintenance

Bases require regular attention:

```
● Feeding : Monthly specimen investment
● Mood management : For living bases, keeping them content
● Repairs : After attacks or flux events
● Seasonal changes : Some bases hibernate or migrate
```
Neglected bases might:

```
● Refuse entry
● Lose capabilities
● Attract unwanted inhabitants
● Wander off (if mobile)
● Die (becoming a different kind of shelter)
```
#### Base Evolution

Bases can grow through:


```
● Regular feeding with quality specimens
● Successful symbiotic bonding
● Surviving significant events together
● Exposure to unusual Flux patterns
```
This growth is narrative, not mechanical—your base develops personality and quirks that
create story opportunities rather than numerical bonuses.

#### Starting a Base

When the party is interested:

1. Find suitable base organism/structure - work with the GM
2. Establish initial symbiosis - might require specific specimens
3. Name it
4. Choose two initial capabilities
5. Determine its feeding preferences


# Running the game


## Running the game

#### Tracks

Tracks represent extended challenges, ongoing situations, or gradual changes that require
multiple actions to resolve. They create structured pacing for complex tasks while
maintaining tension through visible progress (or deterioration).

##### Basic Track Mechanics

**Creating a Track**

```
● GM determines length (typically 3-10 segments) based on complexity/severity
● Each segment represents meaningful progress or change
● Label endpoints and optionally key middle segments
```
**Advancing Tracks**

```
● Successes advance the track by 1 segment (or more for critical successes)
● Failures might add complications, lose progress, or advance a different track
● Multiple characters can contribute to the same track
● Different segments might require different skills
```
##### Track Types

Standard Tracks

Progress from start to completion. Used for:

```
● Extended projects (crafting, research, construction)
● Journeys and travel
● World events progressing
```
Dual-Sided Tracks

Progress fills from both ends toward the middle. The track advances from the left
(worsening), while successes fill segments from the right (preventing the worst outcomes).
Once the advancing threat meets the filled prevention, further successes reverse the track
leftward.

Used for:

```
● Deteriorating situations (poison, disease, structural collapse)
● Rising threats (mob anger, approaching storm, ritual completion)
● Competitive races (who reaches the goal - in the middle - first)
```

This creates dramatic situations where early intervention prevents disaster, but the threat still
worsens before improving.

##### Track Variations

```
● Branching Points Some tracks split based on approach or outcomes:
● Clock Tracks Advance automatically each scene/rest/day:
● Hidden Tracks Players see effects but not the track itself (or only the steps, but not
the labels):
```
#### Running action scenes

During an action scene, whenever the momentum swings to the GM, they can spotlight an
NPC or Foe they control and have it take a Turn similar to a player action.
Afterwards, they can either give back the Momentum to the Players, or spend a Fear to
Spotlight another NPC or Foe. They can continue spending Fear until they don’t have any
left.

##### Titan Combat: The Telegraph Pattern

Large entities—whether planet-beings, void-swimmers, or ancient colossi—operate on
different time scales than normal creatures. Their attacks are powerful but telegraphed,
creating tactical puzzles rather than reflex challenges. Players must observe, interpret, and
respond to warning signs rather than simply trading blows.

Turn Structure

When running massive entities, offset their actions:

1. **Resolve** the previously telegraphed action
    ○ "The geysers erupt where the cracks appeared last turn"
    ○ Apply consequences to anyone who didn't respond
2. **Telegraph** the next action with clear signs
    ○ "The creature's throat sac begins glowing, pulsing with increasing intensity"
    ○ "Gravity shifts—small rocks start falling upward toward its maw"
    ○ "Its thousand eyes all focus on a single point"
3. **Players act** with full knowledge of what's coming
    ○ Can attempt to disrupt the telegraph
    ○ Can move to safety
    ○ Can exploit the creature's committed action

Telegraph Guidelines

**Make tells obvious** : This isn't about surprising players— **it's about forcing hard choices.**
"Save the civilian or dodge the attack?" “Get a Hit in trying to interrupt or get to safety?”

**Different tells for different attacks** :


```
● Physical attacks: Ground cracks, muscles tense, weight shifts
● Energy attacks: Glowing, humming, temperature changes
● Summoning/calling: Songs, pheromones, vibrations
● Environmental: Weather shifts, gravity flux, time distortion
```
**Disruption possibilities** : Some telegraphs can be interrupted:

```
● Attacking the glowing throat sac
● Blocking the summoning call
● Destroying the focusing crystal
● Success might reduce or redirect the attack
```
Scale and Positioning

Large entities often have **zones** rather than single positions. Movement between zones
takes time, creating positioning puzzles.

```
● Head/sensory zone (where it perceives)
● Limbs/appendages (where it strikes)
● Core/body (where it's vulnerable)
● Aura/influence (environmental effects)
```
Example Titan Turn

**The Dormant World-Seed** (a planet-being waking):

_Turn 1_ :

```
● Resolves: (nothing—first turn)
● Telegraphs: Surface cracks appear in geometric patterns
● Players: Investigate, prepare, or flee
```
_Turn 2_ :

```
● Resolves: Crystalline spines erupt from the cracks (damage + difficult terrain)
● Telegraphs: The spines begin resonating, building a harmonic frequency
● Players: Destroy spines, find shelter, or attempt communication
```
_Turn 3_ :

```
● Resolves: Sonic pulse shatters anything crystalline (including equipment)
● Telegraphs: The ground becomes spongy, porous—something rising from beneath
● Players: Escape to solid ground, or prepare to ride whatever emerges
```
