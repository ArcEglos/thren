## Language

```
● There are three main categories of texts
○ Rules text
○ Out of world text descriptions
○ In-world text artifacts
```
**Rules text**

```
● Rules text is short, to the point and crisp
```
**Out of world text descriptions**

```
● Evocative, poetic and bold
● Rich in sensory detail
● Sentence length is varied to produce impactful pacing
● The goal is to anchor the reader in the world
● Presents a world not desperate to explain itself
● Things can be left open, mysterious and unexplained
● Depicts horrible, vile things as well as beautiful ones - and dares to let them stand on
their own without balancing them
```
**In-world text artifacts**

```
● Most of the out of world text descriptions also applies
● Deeply biased by the flawed authors
● Follows the traditions, viewpoints, formats and worldviews of the culture they
originated in
● But also shows these cultures as deeply internally conflicted and changing and
multi-facetted - nothing is ever simple or unanimous and disagreements are
everywhere.
```
**Names and linguistics**

```
● Most things from in-world text artifacts apply
● Be careful to not stereotype or appropriate cultural feel in ways that could be
insensitive
```

# Inspiration


## Inspiration

**IMPORTANT: This collection is just piles of stuff I find interesting or fascinating or
great. This doesn’t mean that all of this has ended up or ever will end up included in
Thren in the end. But I don’t want to throw away this list, as it’s a curated statement of
my tastes in and of itself.**

##### Unsolved

1. How to make the infinitely fractal layeredness and messiness of reality work. Three
    main problems:
       a. There are so many dimensions of messy that it’s really really hard to stay on
          top of things and on-the-fly be this layered
       b. Players still need to be able to have predictions/simulations of the world in
          their head that allows them to make decisions in a way where they feel like
          they have an idea of which decision would have which consequences -
          otherwise they don’t feel like they have agency. Multiple options for this:
             i. Make things more similar to the real world (booring)
ii. Make things simpler (less layered and nuanced and can feel synthetic
and flat)
iii. Be very precise about the places of layering: (probably the best, but
very hard to pull of well)
1. Put lots of textures into aspects that are not part of the
causality-web of the game
2. Make the aspects that _are_ critical to the game causality
either very explicit and actively teach it to the players or make
it simpler/closer to the real world and hope that the layering
and texture carries you
       c. If your stories are supposed to have a point and themes and put a lens on
          something specific and generally be dramatic and sculptural - you want to
          retain some amount of focus and not become too cluttery and chaotic. The
          real world is not very cinematic or sculptural, in many ways because it is so
          messy and denies any attempts at a coherent interpretation. That’s kinda
          exhausting - not a great game. So lived-in yes, but still with intention.
2. Redteaming!
    a. We should run active redteaming to plug system-holes (magic breaking
       societies, etc)
3. If magic is real in this world - which it is - how does technological progress of said
    magic work? It will exist! Let’s not do a medieval stasis thing. Let’s instead figure out
    how to make magical-understanding improvements over time part of societies, it’s
    conflicts, etc
       a. This doesn’t have to mean that people understand how magic works! Maybe
          it’s still a pretty new phenomenon somehow? Or maybe it’s just wildly hard to
          understand because of some path-dependence - or actually, more likely
          because the required machinery for making experiments and measurements
          isn’t developed enough yet? Bottom line is: It can still be extremely
          mysterious and “soft” - the progression and change is the important bit


```
b. Also I do kinda dig the idea of magic actually being very new and this
somehow explaining why society hasn’t fully adapted to it yet etc
c. Oh also one type of progress in this space might be that slowly some folks
are figuring out how to produce predictable repeatable on-demand spells. But
it’s super early and super expensive and only suuuper few are known. And
there is this fun tension between the magic practitioners and the new
“industrialized” way of doing arcane things and <insert massive societal
change and conlifct here>
```

○ Comment:
■ Many modern fantasy authors come from secular or post-Christian
contexts. They don’t personally know what it’s like to have every
choice—diet, marriage, work, travel—filtered through a religious lens. So
when they write “medieval” characters, they accidentally project modern,
secular psychology back onto them. Faith becomes an option, not a
default. Worldbuilders usually design religions as lore (gods, myths,
rituals, symbols), but not as something that actively shapes how
characters live. The result: gods are namedropped, temples exist, but
characters act like 21st-century people with occasional superstitious
seasoning.

Flux Planet-Specific Variations

Different world types emphasize different Flux aspects:

**Void-edge worlds** : Peak might open temporary portals **Water worlds** : Flux dramatically
affects tides and currents **Living planets** : The planet-being's mood follows Flux cycles **Dead
worlds** : Might briefly spark to life during Peak **Garden worlds** : Specimen availability heavily
Flux-dependent


##### Specific rules snippets I like:

```
● I know a guy
● Afflictions (his majesty the worm, p.97/98)
● Shared inventory/vehicle/something like that that is collaboratively managed (the last
caravan, wildsea)
● Clocks/tracks/downtime tracks in general (the last caravan,wildsea, daggerheart, his
majsty the worm)
● Items/things are temporary and/or break - makes it a lot easier to give out powerful
toys, if they are not around forever (his majesty the worm)
○ Just watch out they don't hoard all the good things and don't dare to use them
(maybe more strict inventory limits or something?)
● Fear/hope as self-balancing action economy & turn determinant (daggerheart)
● A character flaw causing a complication gives that player a resource (heroism in the
last caravan)
○ Makes it easier for monkeybrain to gleefully make the character jump into the
blender for the stories' sake
● PC death from Daggerheart
● Loadout change during rest, but also at any time for a price from daggerheart
● From mythic bastionland:
○ Your base stats are things that constantly fluctuate based on how you're
feeling (e.g. a failed check to climb a tree might be a hit to your physical
strength because now you're winded or bruised or something)
○ Guard
○ Feats
○ Gambits
○ Seasonality, passing time & ages
● Players being asked to do ceremonial things on the table (Seven-part Pact end of a -
I think - season procedure)
● Everything on encounter design from silent titans p 8-
● Difficulty or cost to craft based on number of syllables in description (his majesty the
worm commission craft p. 158)
● The group doesn’t have money, just “poor”, “ok”, “well-off”, “rich” (the rest is handled
by the inventory system

##### Special capability pool

```
● [META]: Various things that are currently “Take Strain” rules could also be abilities
(still costing strain, or being otherwise limited)
● Infuse spell creation with custom intent
● Find a species that you can in-the-moment interact with in some way to solve your
problem
```

```
● Push your current transport to go faster than normally possible
● Overload transport capacity temporarily
● A member of the troupe gets emergency-moved by e.g. a branch suddenly appearing
● Find a useful bit of background information about a faction or person
● When your hit succeeds, you get to make another one
● You can take a Mind Strain to go into social debt. Create a -1 connection (you now
owe them) (or even more negative for bigger favors - if you dare). They'll help now
but expect repayment. The GM roleplays the negotiation, making clear through the
NPC's demeanor and demands how serious this debt will be.
● Flux related:
○ Arcanist : Maintain one spell through phase changes
○ Symbiologist: If you have a recipe for your creating, get x bonus
○ Symbiologist : One specimen ignores Falling degradation
```
##### Items

```
● A salve that makes you recover more Body strain than usual, but:
○ If you roll a 1 you’re now permanently desensitized to it
○ If you roll a 1 you take a mind strain instead

# Teaching Tacit Knowledge


# Teaching Tacit Knowledge

_This is a framework for transferring tacit knowledge that I picked up from the founder of
JHourney (Stephen), which he adapted from this post (largely based on US DoD research). I
think this could be a powerful way to transmit research taste, which is famously tacit and
hard to teach, and I think it’s worth experimenting with this._

**Cues, Expectations, and Implications** is a framework for transferring tacit knowledge. The
core idea is that tacit knowledge is chiefly composed of:

1. **Cues** : Knowing what to look for.
2. **Expectations** : Knowing what those cues indicate about the world.
3. **Implications** : Knowing what those expectations imply about your next steps.

The reason these are hard to transfer in writing is that:

1. You learn what to look for and how to tie that into actions by seeing lots of examples.
    You may never have formulated or been taught a unified theory of the domain (one
    might not exist!).
2. Many of the steps and associations are subconscious / implicit. An expert researcher
    just knows that something feels off about a plot. If you ask them they might be able to
    tell you why, but usually what you witness is the expert _acting,_ not them telling you
    how the evidence becomes an action.

In the case of JHourney, apparently, training instructors / facilitators was a real bottleneck for
a long time. The way they overcame this is by having Stephen watch a recorded session of a
facilitator with a participant and speak out loud about (a) what he’s noticing as he watches,
(b) what that implies about the participant’s experience, and (c) how that translates into
action. They recorded Stephen reacting to the original recording, and then have facilitators
watch many such sessions.

Importantly:

1. This isn’t Stephen giving a presentation.
2. It’s not him doing a deep retrospective on a participant’s experience or the facilitator’s
    performance.
3. Rather, it’s him speaking off the cuff about the immediate things he’s noticing.

The reason this matters is that it forces him to make explicit the often-implicit cues he’s
picking up on, and tie those very explicitly to beliefs about the world and then actions based
on those beliefs.

According to Stephen, after adopting this approach facilitator training became relatively
straightforward and JHourney was able to scale a lot faster.

Hailmary crazy idea: Somehow get BLM to right after taping an episode go go through the
VOD and live voiceover the whole thing off the cuff

- World generator
    - Prompted/finetuned LLM that can dream up more things on demand? (maybe
       even canon things? That would be wild. All tables/parties essentially being in
       a shared world. Would require a ton of thought though in terms of how to not
       make interactions terrible. And generally again make the world kina whacky I
       think)
    - Maybe even including illustrations (also finetuned imagegen)?
- Microtools
    - Syllable spell generator
       - Something something gen art creation animation/design

# Generator tools


## Generator tools

In various places, there are mechanics that rely on ad-hoc creation of things, poems,
creatures, etc. This would normally be prohibitively slowing down the game flow. We use
generators to offset this issue.

#### Study

##### LLM Integration for References

###### Generating Source Books

(actually sources might not only be books - maybe some are alive? Or rocks. Or other stuff)

When players discover/acquire references:

```
● Context: [Location/source of book]
● Topic area: [What it covers]
● Quality level: [Authoritative/Standard/Questionable]
● Generate: Book title, author, and table of contents
```
Example output:

```
● "The Cultivator's Companion to Void-Touched Flora"
● By Scholar Yevrin Moss-Tongue (Third Edition)
●
● Table of Contents:
● 1. Safety Protocols for Void Exposure
● 2. Identifying Gravitational Adaptations
● 3. Common Symbiotic Relationships
● 4. Harvesting During Flux Variations
● 5. Storage of Unstable Specimens
● 6. Index of Known Mutations
● Appendix: Emergency Decontamination
●
● Quality: Authoritative for void flora, Standard for general biology
● Condition: Moss-grown binding (ironically), some pages stick together
```
###### Generating Research Results

For specific queries:

```
● Research question: [What player asks]
```

```
● Source used: [Reference book/material]
● Match level: [Perfect/Good/Stretch/Wild]
● Success level: [Failed/Success/Critical]
● Generate: Information discovered
```
This allows dynamic, surprising research discoveries while maintaining consistency.

**Authoritative Sources** :

```
● Original texts, direct observations, primary documents
● Scholar's personal notes on their expertise
● Living specimens for biological research
```
**Standard References** :

```
● Good secondary sources, established textbooks
● Recent travel guides, current maps
● Maintained databases or libraries
```
**Questionable Sources** :

```
● Outdated materials, translations of translations
● Gossip, hearsay, personal opinions
● Damaged or partially destroyed texts
```
###### Physical References

###### Example References

```
● "Grandfather's Migration Charts"
● - Enables: Navigation research for this star cluster
● - Quality: Authoritative for known routes, Standard for variations
● - Condition: Fragile, water-damaged sections illegible
●
● "Handbook of Lesser Planets"
● - Enables: Research on planetary phenomena
● - Quality: Standard for established worlds
● - Condition: Heavy (2x3 grid spaces)
●
● "Whispers and Rumors of the Port"
● - Enables: Social/political research
● - Quality: Questionable but current
● - Condition: Needs constant updates or becomes useless
```

#### Weave

###### Poem generation

Prompt content:

```
● Ordering of syllables
● Distance aspect
● More definition/options for each syllable
● Higher quality embodiment modificators
● Complexity guide
● Good variety of effects/poems (e.g. supportive as well as destructive etc)
● What makes the poem good
● Character's take on & mode of interaction with the arcane
```
#### Socialize

##### Snippets

```
Examples
```
```
● "Values tradition" → Double value when appealing to customs
● "Secret gambling debts" → Enables leverage approach
● "Lost daughter to plague" → Avoid mentioning children
● "Ambitious but cautious" → Frame proposals as safe advancement
```
#### Crafting

**LLM Integration Potential**

Generation prompt structure:

Environment: [Current location details]
Flux Phase: [Current phase]
Tags sought: [Player-declared tags]
Success Level: [Roll result]
Generate specimen with name, tags, description, abundance, and shape



# Rule Design Notes


## Design Notebook

**IMPORTANT: These notes were not always kept in sync when rules or systems were
changed/tweaked/iterated. So there are probably a bunch of outdated facts in here.
However, it’s probably still useful as a snapshot insight into how I was thinking about
what.**

#### Base skills setup

###### Why This Works

```
● Enforces symbiotic theme : Characters literally need each other
● Action multiplication : Collaboration creates more actions, not just enables them
● Meaningful specialization : Each rating tier serves distinct purpose
● Emergency valves : Strain allows pushing limits when desperate
● Clear party composition : Groups can identify and fill gaps
```
###### Open Questions for Playtesting

```
● Should masters (4) have limits on how many they can teach per scene?
● Should collaboration require specific positioning/range?
● How does skill progression work? (especially for long campaigns)
```
#### Study

###### Why These Choices

**Mental Loadout** : Represents cognitive limits. You can't hold everything in active memory.
Creates meaningful choices about what to prepare for.

**Physical references** : Knowledge has weight and takes space. Books can be lost.
Information is treasure worth protecting.

**Exhaustion over failure** : Research usually works but costs mental resources. Push too
hard and you start making things up.

**Source quality matters** : Not all information is equal. Better sources give better results, but
you work with what you have.

**Collaborative by default at low skill** : Research is hard. Most people need help to do it well.
Masters can work alone but still benefit from collaboration.


**Integration with strain** : Mental exhaustion ties to overall character fragility. Knowledge work
is real work with real costs.

### Open Questions

###### Mechanical Tuning

1. Should Mental Loadout size vary by skill or be fixed?
2. Is 3/5/7 exhaustion boxes appropriately scaled?
3. Should some topics be impossible without specific sources?
4. How many reference books can characters reasonably carry?

###### Integration Details

1. Can crafted items serve as reference sources?
2. Should social connections provide reference access?
3. Can navigation routes be researched without traveling them?
4. Do syllabic entities provide research bonuses?

###### Edge Cases

1. What if no one has Study skill?
2. Can references be copied or must they be originals?
3. Should some knowledge be dangerous to research?
4. How do language barriers affect research?

###### Campaign Scaling

1. Do references improve over campaign time?
2. Can characters create their own references?
3. Should legendary references exist with special properties?
4. How do cultural differences affect research interpretation?

### Play Examples

###### Basic Research Scene

"I need to know this creature's weakness."

```
● Loadout includes "Regional fauna"
● Reference: "Hunter's Bestiary" (Standard)
● Match: Good (creature is variant of known type)
● Method: Standard Research (1 exhaustion)
● Roll: 5 (success with insight)
● Result: "Vulnerable to salt, but this variant has developed partial resistance"
```

###### Desperate Research

"The planet-being is stirring! What will it do?"

```
● Loadout: Switching from "Trade routes" (1 strain)
● Reference: None available
● Match: No Source (Study 4 only)
● Method: Deep Dive (3 exhaustion total)
● Roll: 3 (failure)
● Result: Convincing but completely wrong prediction
```
###### Collaborative Research

Study 2 Symbiologist + Study 3 Student:

```
● Symbiologist provides specimen (Authoritative source)
● Student provides research expertise
● Split 2 exhaustion between them
● Both learn the discovered information
```
This system makes knowledge valuable, costly, and uncertain—perfect for a universe where
understanding comes through careful observation but even expertise has limits.

#### Physically Act

###### Why These Choices

**Single skill with approaches** : Reduces character sheet complexity while maintaining
tactical depth. Approaches create meaningful choices without tracking multiple numbers.

**Equipment as enabler** : Tools and weapons change what's possible rather than providing
numerical bonuses. Maintains focus on fiction over arithmetic.

**Universal resolution** : Combat and non-combat use identical mechanics. Learn once, apply
everywhere.

**Biological equipment** : Reinforces symbiotic themes. Your gear is alive and has needs.

**Strain over HP inflation** : Characters remain fragile throughout. A lucky hit from a weak
opponent still matters.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Combat flows quickly without special subsystems
● Physical tasks feel weighty and consequential
```

```
● Equipment choices matter narratively
● Collaboration occurs naturally
● Fragility persists regardless of advancement
```
#### Socialize

###### Why These Choices

**Pre-investment model** : Eliminates awkward mechanical interruption during roleplay. Social
capital becomes literal preparation—getting introductions, spreading rumors, calling in favors
happen before the scene.

**Network as physical resource** : The web of connections becomes a campaign artifact that
evolves over time. Watching it grow and shift creates emergent narrative.

**Chain spending as actual movement** : Favors ripple through the network, depleting
multiple relationships. This makes intermediaries matter and creates natural limitations.

**Connection types with properties** : Different approaches create different risks and rewards.
Quick dirty connections offer power but instability. Patient honest building creates lasting
resources.

**Numerical decay** : Clear bookkeeping that creates campaign rhythm. Seasonal maintenance
becomes strategically important without overwhelming complexity.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Social encounters flow naturally without mechanical interruption
● Preparation becomes as important as execution
● Networks feel alive with finite, depleting resources
● Different social strategies have long-term consequences
● Information (snippets) becomes tradeable currency
● Going into debt creates future complications
● The most connected character isn't necessarily the one with the highest Social skill
```
###### Tone and Impact

The system emphasizes that relationships require investment and maintenance. Power
comes from what you've built and preserved, not just natural charisma. The network
physically shifting as it's used creates visible consequences for social manipulation. Every
favor called in, every lie told, every debt incurred leaves marks on the web of connections
that define the campaign's social landscape.


#### Crafting

###### Example

**Challenge** : Cross a chasm

**Using** :

```
● Voidwhisper Sap [adhesive] [weightless]
● Iron Seedpods [explosive-growth] [magnetic]
```
**Connections** :

1. [adhesive] bonds to cliff (conservative, 4+)
2. [explosive-growth] extends bridge (creative, 5+)
3. [weightless] prevents collapse (creative, 5+)

**Roll** : 4, 3, 6

```
● Adhesive works
● Growth fails
● Weightless critically succeeds
```
**Result** : "A floating but short bridge - you'll need to jump the last few feet"

###### Why This Works

**Reinforces Core Themes** :

```
● Technology through symbiosis, not manufacture
● Discovery through observation
● Nothing is permanent or guaranteed
● Collaboration enhances capability
```
**Creates Interesting Decisions** :

```
● Limited grid space forces tough choices
● Tag declaration requires planning
● Connection explanations reward creativity
● Maintenance adds ongoing cost
```
**Integrates With Other Systems** :

```
● Research reveals specimen properties
● Navigation determines available specimens
● Social connections might provide rare specimens
● Strain flows through as universal currency
```
**Supports Documentary Tone** :


```
● Daily collection routines like field researchers
● Specimens degrade and change
● Hypothesis testing through dice
● Knowledge grows through study
```
### Open Questions

###### Mechanical Tuning

1. **Grid size** : Is 5x4 right? Should it scale with creature size?
2. **Track lengths** : How many segments for typical projects?
3. **Specimen stacking** : Can you carry multiples of same specimen?
4. **Shape variety** : How many distinct shapes? Random or type-based?

###### Integration Points

1. **Multiple crafters** : Can several Symbiosis users collaborate on one project?
2. **Failed projects** : Do tracks reset, regress, or branch?
3. **Companion preferences** : Should creatures refuse certain specimen types?
4. **Tag limits** : Maximum tags per specimen? Can all be used at once?

###### Edge Cases

1. **Emergency crafting without specimens** : Any fallback options?
2. **Specimen trading** : How does this work with personal grids?
3. **Permanent creations** : Can anything be made to last indefinitely?
4. **Dangerous specimens** : Should some have storage risks?

###### Campaign Evolution

1. **Advanced specimens** : How do late-game materials differ?
2. **Legendary specimens** : Single-use game-changers?
3. **Specimen cultivation** : Can players grow their own?
4. **Cross-world specimens** : Special properties from void travel?

### Why These Design Choices

**Tag-based rather than mechanical properties** : Allows creative interpretation while
maintaining structure. Players narrate their scientific discovery.

**Grid tetris over slots** : Visual, tactile, creates natural limits without bookkeeping. Makes
storage an active puzzle.

**Abundance words over numbers** : More flexible, reduces tracking, feels organic.

**Morning declaration** : Creates planning phase, makes exploration intentional, establishes
daily rhythm.


**Connection-based resolution** : Rewards creative thinking over having "correct" ingredients.
Makes combination an act of discovery.

**First die momentum** : Ties risk directly to approach. Conservative = safe, wild = dangerous.

**Research reveals tags** : Creates synergy between subsystems, knowledge has mechanical
benefit.

**Maintenance rolls** : Nothing is permanent, creates ongoing engagement with specimens,
reinforces living nature.

The system aims to make crafting feel like biological field research rather than mechanical
assembly, supporting the setting's themes while creating engaging gameplay decisions at
every step.

#### Flux

### Design Philosophy

###### Why These Choices

**Affects biological/energetic systems only** : Keeps focus on the "living universe" theme.
Physical and social actions remain constant while the world changes around them.

**Predictable with exceptions** : Players can plan strategically, but cosmic events create
surprises that prevent perfect optimization.

**Risk/reward scaling** : Each phase offers opportunities and dangers. No phase is strictly
"better"—each serves different purposes.

**Strategic timing** : The Flux transforms "when" into as important a decision as "how." This
supports the documentary tone—observers must understand natural rhythms.

**Simple mechanical changes** : Each system has one or two knobs that Flux adjusts (affinity,
exposure, preservation) rather than completely different rules.

**Multi-world complexity** : Advanced play involves tracking multiple Flux cycles, creating rich
strategic depth without rules complexity.

### Strategic Implications

The Flux creates meaningful timing decisions:

###### Journey Planning

"Do we travel now during Calm (safe but expensive) or wait for Rising (risky but fast)?"


###### Resource Management

"Peak is coming—should we attempt that impossible craft or preserve our specimens?"

###### Risk Assessment

"We're entering Falling—do we push through with strain or wait for the next Calm?"

###### Multi-World Coordination

"The archive world is entering Calm (perfect for research) while the harvest world hits Rising
(ideal for specimen collection)"

### Play Examples

###### Strategic Decision

"The void-swimmer route opens during Peak, cutting travel time from 12 days to 3. But we'll
take double Exposure and our navigator is already struggling. Do we wait for Rising (safer
but 6 days) or push through?"

###### Phase Optimization

"We need to craft the antidote, but we're in Falling—all connections are harder. If we wait 2
days for Calm, preservation is perfect but the patient might not survive. Take the risk or
wait?"

###### Multi-World Planning

"The library world enters Calm tomorrow (perfect for research), but the breeding grounds hit
Peak tonight (rare specimens available). Split the party or miss an opportunity?"

This system makes the universe feel alive and breathing, where timing and adaptation
matter as much as skill and resources.

#### Strain, Momentum, Adrenalin, Guard

### Design Notes

**~40-50% chance of momentum shifting** regardless of success/failure

This system ensures:

```
● Constant tension : Success doesn't mean safety
```

```
● Player agency : Choose when to push vs. accept consequences
● Resource management : Strain becomes strategic currency
● Pacing control : GM always has potential to intervene
● Subsystem identity : Each resolution feels mechanically distinct
```
### Play Examples

**Physical Combat** : "I rolled 4, 5, 6, 2 - that's a success! But wait, that 2 means momentum
shifts?" "Yeah, unless you want to take Body strain to maintain control." "It's early in the
fight... I'll take the strain."

**Social Negotiation** : "The merchant agrees to your terms. Flip for momentum... Heads. The
GM gets a turn." "Actually, I'll take Mind strain to keep control - we need this deal clean."

**Spell Casting** : "Your spell works perfectly, but two syllables landed writing-side down.
Momentum shifts." "Let it shift. I can't afford more Mind strain right now."

**Research** : "You find the answer! But you drew the Jack of Spades. That's a black suit." "GM,
take your Fear token. I'm saving my strain for later."

### The Scar Spiral

Multiple scars create cascading fragility:

```
● First scar: Limit 5→4 (dangerous but manageable)
● Second scar: Limit 4→3 (every session becomes risky)
● Third scar: Limit 3→2 (death looms constantly)
● Fourth scar: Limit 2→1 (essentially unplayable)
```
This forces characters toward retirement or desperate quests for healing.

### Design Philosophy

###### Why These Choices

**Scars over simple death** : Creates lasting consequences that accumulate over a campaign.
Characters become marked by their experiences.

**Desperate push** : Provides player agency in critical moments. They choose their fate rather
than being subject to dice alone.

**Grieving over elimination** : Death creates story rather than ending it. The party must care
for their wounded companion.

**Gradual rebonding** : New bonds become character development rather than mechanical
necessity.


**The death spiral** : Intentionally creates pressure toward retirement or legendary healing
quests. Not all stories end in glory.

**Flaw rewards** : Players want their characters to fail interestingly. The mechanical reward
aligns with dramatic storytelling.

###### What This Achieves

```
● Every dangerous situation carries genuine threat
● Failure creates problems to solve, not characters to replace
● Death becomes meaningful and rare
● Long campaigns see characters accumulate history
● The Vostrani dual nature becomes mechanically essential
● Party bonds strengthen through shared trauma
```
###### Tone and Feel

This system supports the documentary tone of Thren—nature doesn't care about fairness,
but survival creates profound bonds between those who endure together. Characters who
survive multiple adventures together will bear the scars of their journey, creating a living
history of the campaign.

#### Further systems

### Design Notes

###### Why These Systems

**Titan Combat** : Creates tactical puzzles rather than HP races. Every massive entity
encounter becomes memorable through the telegraph pattern. Players feel clever for
interpreting signs and responding appropriately.

**Abstract Wealth** : Eliminates coin counting while preserving resource management through
the inventory system. Wealth becomes another fictional positioning element rather than
bookkeeping.

**Living Bases** : Reinforces symbiotic themes—even your home is a relationship to maintain.
Creates natural adventure hooks through base needs and moods.

**Seasonal rhythm** : Creates predictable maintenance beats without overwhelming
bookkeeping. Everything updates at once in a ritual fashion.

**Testimony-based progression** : Advancement emerges from actual play rather than XP
tracking. The stories you tell determine how you grow.


**Collective world-building** : Players shape the world through their actions and testimonies.
The campaign world evolves based on what happened.

**Retirement over death** : Characters complete their arcs and become part of the world's
fabric rather than simply dying.

###### The Ritual Experience

Season's end should feel like a meaningful pause:

```
● Light candles or change lighting
● Use formal language for testimonies
● Take turns without interruption
● Record major events in a campaign journal
● Celebrate growth and mourn losses
```
This ritualistic approach makes the mechanical bookkeeping feel like part of the story rather
than interrupting it.

###### Why Living equipment cycle

**No permanent loss** : Items return, removing the feel-bad of breaking favorite gear

**Anti-hoarding** : Can't save the bloom for the perfect moment—use it or it goes dormant
anyway

**Biological consistency** : Everything in Thren has cycles and needs

**Creates rhythm** : Equipment availability becomes another tactical consideration

**Narrative opportunities** : "We need to wake the ancient armor" becomes a quest

###### Integration

These systems support but don't complicate the core game:

```
● Titan combat uses existing Physical and strain systems
● Wealth works with the specimen inventory grid
● Bases tie into specimen gathering and social connections
```
Each adds flavor without adding complexity, maintaining focus on the core pillars of
symbiosis, exploration, and fragility.


#### Navigation using tracks and various skills

### Why This Works

```
● Different skills shine at different moments - not just "the navigator does
everything"
● Meaningful choices with risk/reward rather than just "pick the safe path"
● Collaborative by default - multiple party members contribute
● Complications feel natural - momentum shifts create logical problems
● The world feels alive - spawning seasons, predator behavior, hungry groves
```

# Engine



# Basic Rules


## Welcome

You are a group of Sethrem. Each of you an individuum formed by a Kemerin and a Torrnek
bonding.
This world is not kind. You are not invincible. Sometimes the only thing you can do is run.

## Basic rules

##### Dice pools

When asked to roll a Dicepool(n), roll n d6 and take the highest number. A 4-5 is a result
with some complication, a 6 is a full success. 1-3 is a failure. Unless specified otherwise.
If n = 0, roll 2d6 and take the lowest, for n=-1 roll 3d6 take lowest, etc.
For any dicepool roll the GM can also add an additional modifier on the amount of dice
depending on the situation.

##### Duality

How the body-side - the Torrnek - and the mind-side - the Kemerin - are interacting is core to
your character.

#### Abilities

You have a collection of capabilities that are unique to you. They give you access to skills
and modify the rules that apply to you in some way.

#### Skills

When you take an action that is neither easy nor impossible for you, you use a skill to
determine the result. There are five skills:

```
● Socialize (Mind-side): Convince, lie, negotiate, misdirect, inspire, hide intentions,
build trust
● Study (Mind-side): Research, recall facts, analyze, use references
● Physically act (Body-side): Fight, lift, sneak, climb, break, quick reflexes, push
through
● Symbiosis (Body-side): Biological crafting, specimen combination, creature handling
● Weave (Both-sides): Create spells, throw syllables, read patterns
```
You get access to these skills based on your abilities. If you don’t have access to a skill you
normally can’t do the associated actions. If you’re desperate enough you might attempt an
improvised skill check.


##### Observation

Everyone can observe, regardless of skills. Roll a Dicepool(2 - Strain + Collaborator). Others
can collaborate if they have any knowledge of the skill, each collaborator adds a die to the
pool.

##### Improvised skill check

For unusual situations (e.g., "cooking alien soup") where skills don’t apply:

1. GM describes the challenge
2. Player explains their approach using their character background/capabilities
3. Determine dicepool size:
    ○ difficulty vs character match (excellent match for something easy: six dice,
       desperate attempt on something really hard: zero dice)
    ○ applicable strain
    ○ 1 dice extra for each character collaborating if reasonable for the task
4. Roll
5. One die has a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

#### Strain

You don’t lose hitpoints, you accumulate Body Strain and Mind Strain. If you get
overwhelmed you shut down or risk - partial - death.

#### Rest

Getting a full rest takes 8 hours. If you don’t get a rest for more than 24h you’re risking
strain.

#### Momentum

In action scenes, momentum flows between GM and the players. It is determined by
momentum checks depending on the skill used.

When a momentum check would fail, you can:

1. Maintain control
    a. Take 2 Strain (Mind of Body, depending on action)
    b. Keep momentum on your side
2. Accept the shift. The GM chooses ONE:
    a. **Immediate Turn** : GM acts right after your action resolves
    b. **Bank Fear Token** : Store for later escalation
    c. **Complication** : Something in the scene gets worse for you

##### Inadequacy


You have an inadequacy that is impacting you and can ruin things in the worst moments. For
example:

- Regret: You’re haunted by something you did (or didn’t) do
- Recklessness: Sometimes you ignore your - or others’ - safety in pursuit of your goal
- Fear: If you think about it too much you get overwhelmed
- Blame: There’s someone responsible for all the bad that’s happened to you

When you act on your inadequacy in a way that causes complications, you clear one strain.

#### Create your character

Pick 10 Abilities. Write your character profile and decide on your inadequacy. Pick if you’re a
youth, adult or mature.


# Strain


## Strain

#### Strain

You don’t lose hitpoints, you accumulate Body Strain and Mind Strain. If you get
overwhelmed you shut down or risk - partial - death.

##### Accumulating

**Voluntarily:** As the least bad option in bad situations, you can take strain to solve an
immediate problem
**Involuntarily:** Getting hurt, experiencing terrible things or being exhausted can cause strain

##### Recovery

Clear two Strain on each Rest.
Medical remedies and Abilities can clear additional Strain.

##### Limits

Your default limit for both body and mind strain is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

When you hit the limit on the Strain of one side, you have two options:

1. Strained side shuts down
2. Desperate push - roll 1d6 immediately:
    a. **1-3** : **Death** - that side of the bond dies
    b. **4-6** : Clear 4 Strain, continue functioning

##### Shutdown

You’re overwhelmed. Something inside you gives up. This will have lasting consequences.

**You take a Scar:** The Strain limit for the side shutting down is permanently reduced by 2.
Work with the GM to define the scar narratively.
Removing a scar is a major quest in itself.

Effects:

- **Body shutdown:** The Body becomes unresponsive while the Mind observes,
    terrified.
- **Mind shutdown:** The Mind goes catatonic while the Body continues, vaguely aware
    the party are friends.
- **Both sides shut down** : Complete catatonia

#### Adrenaline

The blood is pumping through your veins, you rolled your ankle and you didn’t even notice.


##### Hits

During dangerous scenes, the Body tracks physical damage as hits, separate from strain.
Any hits you receive first consume your Guard, then accumulate. As long as you stay below
your overwhelmed threshold you are not impaired. If you hit this threshold your adrenaline
immediately crashes.

Your default overwhelmed threshold is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

##### Crash

Once the dangerous scene is over - or you hit your overwhelm threshold - your adrenaline
crashes. Your actions catch up to you:

```
● Every hit converts to 1 Body strain
● Medical attention can reduce conversion
```
##### Guard

You start with 1 Guard. Abilities and Equipment can increase your Guard. It replenishes once
the dangerous scene is over.


# Skills



# Physically act


## Physically act

Fight, lift, sneak, climb, break, quick reflexes, push through

**Physical refine:**

**- You help an ally with their action
- Roll 2d6
- Any successes get added**

**Physical initiate:**

**- Add 2 to your dicepool for observation related to physical activity
- You have access to the physical skill
- Your body strain limit is increased by 2
- Your hit overwhelm limit is increased by 2**

##### Approach

When doing something physical, first decide your approach. Some might be easier than
others. Your equipment and abilities influence which of them suit you.

1. **Force** : Direct, overwhelming, exhausting
2. **Finesse** : Precise, efficient, quiet
3. **Endurance** : Persistent, grinding, inevitable

##### Resolution

For immediate actions and combat, roll a Dicepool(3 - Strain). For extended tasks use a
Track with multiple steps, potentially with contribution from multiple characters. One die has
a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

You may choose to take physical strain to:

```
● Force an approach without proper tools on a task that is possible (2 strain)
● Add one to a die after you rolled (2 strain)
● Add a die to your pool (1 strain)
```
Any extra dice that are success after the first:

```
● Reduce time required
● Accomplish with style/stealth
● Create advantages for allies
● During combat:
○ Bolster the Attack for +1 additional Hit
○ Repel a foe away from you
○ Stop a foe from moving with their next action or until your next action
```

```
○ Impair a weapon on its next action or until your next action
○ Knock a foe down
● Or similar
```
##### Equipment

Tools and equipment have a big influence on the approaches you can use for physical tasks
and how easy or hard they are. Approaches or entire tasks can be entirely impossible
without the right equipment.

```
● Climbing gear : Enables Finesse approach on climbs
● Sledgehammer : Enables Force approach vs stone/metal
● Breathing symbiote : Enables Endurance in hostile atmosphere
● Lock picks : Required for Finesse approach on locks
```
The same also applies for weapons

```
● Light weapons (knives, clubs): 1 Hit per success, finesse approach available, can
be concealed
● Heavy weapons (hammers, axes): 2 Hits per success, force approach only, can’t be
concealed
● Range weapons (bows): Allow Hits from range, useless up close
```
```
and armor:
```
```
● Light (leather, cloth): Guard +1
● Medium (chitin, wood): Guard + 2, finesse approach at -1 die
● Heavy (metal, stone): Guard + 3, force approach only, endurance tasks +1 strain
```

# Weave


## Weave

Magic operates through the manipulation of fundamental sound-patterns called
syllables—vibrational constructs that can reshape reality when properly arranged.

##### Casting Spells

A spell is a poem that defines what the spell does - subject to interpretation. You cast Spells
at will, but each Spell is single use.
If you stretch the meaning of the poem, the GM might ask for rolling a Dicepool to see if you
can control the energy - the spell goes off either way, but the check decides how close to the
desired effect. You can take a Body Strain or Mind Strain to add a die to the pool for each
Strain taken.

The distance of Spells is by default "within view" - but depending on the poem things might
work better or worse over different distances.
On a rest, lose all spells you currently hold.

To keep a spell after casting it or over a rest, take a body strain.

##### Creating spells

You can create Spells during a Rest. The complexity and power of your spells is limited by
your Affinity.

Affinity = 3 + Flux modifier - Strain (higher of Body&Mind)

The Ritual:

```
● Take any number of Syllable Embodiments
● Throw them
● Group them by the line they point towards on the throw area
● Each group becomes a spell
● You can cut a group into two spells by taking 1 Mind Strain for each cut you want to
make
● If you have innate syllables, add each of them to an existing spell
```
You can take 1 Mind Strain to do a rapid creation ritual taking just a few seconds. Your
affinity for spells created by this ritual is zero.

##### Flux interaction

Magic is massively influenced by the flux pattern on a planet!

```
● Calm : No effect
● Rising : Affinity + 1
● Peak :
```

```
○ Affinity +2
○ Using consumable syllable embodiments doesn’t degrade them
○ Spell interpretation is more malleable
● Falling :
○ Affinity becomes 0
○ Using consumable syllable embodiments fully consumes them
```
##### Leaking spells

A spell leaks some or all of its syllables if it is more complex than your affinity when you
create it.

Effects of leaking spells can range from mild (a single Mhir leaking might mean that if you
touch paper it leaves it wet) to disastrous (five Durn leaking could mean you're becoming as
heavy as a rock your size and are mostly petrified)

##### Innate Syllables

A syllable that is deeply embedded into a character that they are able to add to spells at will
in a controlled fashion.

Acquiring such an innate syllable usually takes a sizable toll on the body due to the intimate
entangling of the host and the arcane. The exact shape is often (but not always) related to
the syllable in question. Someone with innate Mhir might develop gills or constantly damp
skin, while innate Keth could cause a person to exist partially in multiple states
simultaneously.

##### Syllabic Vocabulary

The known syllables each embody fundamental concepts:

```
● Zhex - Fast directed movement, momentum, pursuit
● Ilt - Compression, narrowness, passage through constraints
● Sahn - Stationarity, stillness, patience, quiet
● Wyrv - Bending, rotation, circular motion, return
● Bhol - Expansion, swelling, growth, generosity
● Pyr - Warmth, glow, light, comfort (never fire)
● Vod - Absence, void, negation, without
● Yoth - Growth, exuberance, wild flourishing, indulgence
● Qem - Order, thought, pattern recognition, mind
● Mhir - Water, flow, adaptation, cleansing
● Durn - Substance, earth, weight, permanence
● Keth - Edge, threshold, boundary, between
```

##### Syllable Embodiments

The embodiment of Syllables - the physical items used when creating spells - can be more
vague or precise, better or worse. The simplest ones are reasonably common trinkets, exotic
ones can be reasons for an adventure in itself.

Better embodiments give additional constraints on the poem to get either more powerful or
more predictable results (or, rarely, both).

Embodiments can be stable or degrade or break with usage.


# Socialize


## Socialize

##### The Network Web

The table is part of a network of social connections - each with their own character and
depth.

This social network exists as a physical play aid:

```
● Index cards for NPCs arranged on table
● Colored lines drawn between cards showing relationships:
○ Green = Clean (honest foundations)
○ Yellow = Pressured (leverage/obligation)
○ Red = Dirty (built on deception)
● Points/tokens on lines representing available capital
● Snippets noted on cards ("values tradition," "fears scandal," "lost daughter to
plague")
```
##### Social Encounters

The attitude of NPCs you encounter in a scene will be based on the connections you have
with them.

"The Harbor Master greets you warmly—the Guild's letter clearly carries weight, and the
dockworkers mentioned your name. 'Inspector,' she says, studying your forged credentials, 'I
wasn't expecting an inspection today...'"

The conversation flows naturally without mechanical interruption. The social capital has
already shaped the scene. NPCs still have their own interests and constraints to navigate,
don’t expect a close connection to just mean you get what you want.

Take 1 Strain to have a backup show up during the conversation if things are going south.

Resolution (If Needed)

Only when the outcome remains uncertain you roll a Dicepool(Connection - Strain). One die
has a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

The Approach of your connections affects how success manifests.

Dirty Connection Exposure

When using dirty connections, roll a single d6 at the beginning of the scene for each:

```
● 1-2 : Exposed immediately—scene turns hostile
● 3-4 : Suspicion raised—future complication
● 5-6 : Deception holds... for now
```

Take 1 Mind Strain to hold together an exposed connection until after the scene has
concluded.

##### Building Capital

When you interact with others, your social network changes and evolves.
Complete favors, find a pen pal, save or protect someone to gain points. Apply pressure or
blackmail to use your leverage to force points, or construct elaborate lies to swindle points.

The type of connection depends on how you built it, not what you want it to be:

**Honest** : Building genuine trust through mutual benefit (clean)

```
● Slow to build, slow to decay
● NPCs may exceed expectations when helping
```
**Leverage** : Using power, resources, or obligation (pressured)

```
● Quick to establish but requires maintenance
● NPCs comply but remember being pressured
```
**Deceptive** : Lies, false identities, misdirection (dirty)

```
● Powerful but inherently unstable
● Risk of catastrophic exposure
```
You can play these out as social encounters or summarize them as narrated processes,
depending on the situation and the preferences of the table. Also sending letters and other
actions can be useful for this. Not everything needs to be a conversation.

##### Moving Capital Through the Network

When you ask for an introduction, you're spending your points asking intermediaries to
spend THEIR capital on your behalf, probably taking a “cut”. Long chains can get quite
inefficient - or risky.

NPCs can refuse if they can't afford the social cost:

```
● "I don't have enough pull with them anymore"
● "I'm saving my favor with them for something important"
● "After what happened last time? My reputation with them is already strained"
```
Take 1 Mind Strain to push an intermediary beyond their comfort zone in making a
connection.

##### Snippets

Information about NPCs that modifies social interactions:

```
● Applying the correct snippet doubles dice from that connection
```

● Wrong application might backfire spectacularly
● Unknown snippets can be discovered through Study or Social observation


# Symbiosis


## Symbiosis

Technology in Thren emerges from biological cooperation rather than mechanical
construction. Characters collect living specimens and combine their essential properties to
solve problems. Every creation involves working with living systems, maintaining the "no fire"
taboo while reinforcing the symbiotic theme.

##### Specimen

Discovery & Collection

**At the end of each Rest** : You declare 2 Tags or specific Specimen you’re watching for.

Take 1 Body Strain to swap the tags you look for while on the road

**When starting a Rest** : Roll Dicepool(3 - Strain), modified by:

```
● Environments encountered during the day
● Whether party rushed or took time
```
Distribute successes on declared tags to prioritize.

**Specimen Generation**

Specimens consist of:

```
● Name : Evocative identifier
● Tags : 2-4 mechanical properties [adhesive] [weightless] [void-touched]
● Description : One sentence of flavor
● Abundance : Plentiful / Sufficient / Scarce / Trace
● Shape : Tetris-style grid shape for storage
```
Research using the Knowledge Skill can reveal additional hidden tags of a Specimen.

Example:

Voidwhisper Sap
[adhesive] [weightless] [Peak-sensitive]
"Amber secretion that seems to fall upward, humming faintly"
Abundance: Sufficient
Shape: 1x3 liquid strip

Abundance & Consumption

```
● Plentiful : Use freely, many applications
● Sufficient : 2-3 uses
● Scarce : 1-2 uses
```

```
● Trace : Single use only
```
Abundance degrades with use, depending on the projects you use the Specimen for.

Storage

Specimens need to be stored with the Group Companion.

**At each rest** , roll 1d6 per specimen. On a 1 it decays and is lost.

Take 1 Body Strain to prevent a Specimen from decaying.

##### Combination

1. **Declare Intent** : State what you're trying to create/solve
2. **Select Specimens & Tags** : Choose which specimens and specific tags to use
3. **Explain Connections** : Narrate how tags work together
    ○ Each connection links two tags logically
    ○ Creative interpretation encouraged
4. **Roll Connection Test** : 1d6 per connection + 1d6 for each Body Strain
    ○ 1: Backfire
    ○ 2-3: Failure
    ○ 4-6: Success
    ○ Failures on Strain dice shorten longevity/durability of result

Take 1 Body Strain to reroll a connection

Resolution

**Field Crafting (Immediate):**

Interpret behavior of result based on which connections succeeded.
The first d6 is also the momentum die.

**Project Crafting (Long-term)**

```
● Successes advance track that many segments
● Failures add new requirements
● Backfires may branch track or demand different approach
```
Project crafting happens during a Rest, you can only do one session per rest.

Take a Strain appropriate for the project to force an additional project session during a rest.

##### Flux Interaction

```
● Calm : No effect
● Rising : More Specimens (+1 tag)
● Peak :
○ Plentiful Specimens (+1 tag & +1 die to dicepool)
```

○ Connections succeed on a 3+
○ Decayed specimens mutate into something interesting
● **Falling** :
○ All specimen maintenance rolls at -2
○ Project tracks lose 1 segment each rest you don’t work on them
○ Connections succeed only on 5-6


# Study


## Study

##### Mental Loadout

You maintain a **Mental Loadout** of reference materials you currently made yourself familiar
with. You can only use reference materials from this loadout.

**Loadout slots** : (4 - Strain)

**During Rest** : Free reorganization of entire loadout

You can take 1 Mind Strain to swap out one item in your loadout at any time.

##### Reference Materials

Reference materials enable research and determine quality of results.

References are physical items that:

```
● Take up inventory space
● Can be lost, damaged, or stolen
● Vary in quality and scope
● May require specific conditions to use (light, quiet, language)
```
##### Exhaustion

Studying unknown fields can be exhausting. You’ll need to take a break after a while.

**Track size by Study skill** :

```
● Study 2: 3 boxes
● Study 3: 5 boxes
● Study 4: 7 boxes
```
When exhaustion track overflows, take a Mind Strain for each overflow

You clear 3 Exhaustion during each Rest.

##### Research Process

1. Pick research depth

**Quick Scan** (seconds/minutes):

```
● No exhaustion cost
● Surface information only
● Requires Good Match or better
```

**Standard Research** (hours):

```
● 2 exhaustion
● Complete answers within scope
● Can attempt with any match level
```
**Deep Dive** (half day):

```
● 3 exhaustion
● Reveals hidden connections
● Treats source as one level better
```
**Cross-Reference** (full day):

```
● 5 exhaustion
● Combine multiple sources
● Use best source's match level and treat it as one better than that
● Can reveal contradictions
```
Take 1 Mind Strain to speed up research by one category.

2. Consult reference material

If you have more than one Mind Strain, treat sources as one level worse.

**Perfect Match** (source directly covers question):

```
● Automatic success, no roll needed
● Example: Using creature manual for that exact creature
```
**Good Match** (source covers general topic):

```
● Automatic success for basic info
● Roll d6 (4+) for deeper insights
● Example: Using biology text for new specimen
```
**Stretch** (source is related/adjacent):

```
● Roll d6, need 4+ for success
● Failure = plausible but wrong
● Example: Using plant guide for fungi
```
**Wild Stretch** (barely connected):

```
● Roll d6, need 6 for success
● Failure = dangerous misinformation
● Example: Using poetry for navigation
```
**No Source** (pure deduction):

```
● Not possible
```

If you roll a d6, it is also a momentum die.


# Items & Equipment


## Items & Equipment

#### Companion

You and the group have a shared companion creature. It carries your effects while you’re on
the road, functioning as your inventory.

It has a maximum amount of things it can carry and can take Strain, too. It may also have
capabilities that influence how it can move, how much it can carry, and what its needs are.
Generally these creatures are just intelligent enough to follow simple instructions such as
waiting on the group somewhere, helping to watch out for danger or moving in specified
ways.

The group can have multiple companions, but can only take one of them with you at a time.

#### Equipment

Special equipment in Thren isn't manufactured—it's cultivated, befriended, or harvested from
creatures.

**Basic equipment** without special properties - simple weapons, tools, armor - never
degrade.
**Living equipment** - with special abilities/effects - has an active/dormant cycle. When
dormant, it loses its special properties.

**Example cycles:**

```
● Single Bloom : "This void-swimmer spine can pierce any armor... once per season"
● Flux Sensitive : "These navigator moths only wake during Peak Flux"
● Feed to Wake : "The armor sleeps unless fed rare specimens"
● Exhaustion Cycle : "After three uses, needs a full season of rest"
```
#### Shopping

The party shares a level of wealth. You can afford to buy anything that matches your level of
wealth - assuming it is available.

Levels of wealth:

**Destitute** : Cannot maintain equipment, shelter, or regular meals

```
● Take strain from poor conditions
● Cannot purchase anything
```
**Poor** : Basic survival met, nothing more


```
● Simple food, shared shelter
● Basic supplies (rope, torches via bio-luminescence, simple tools)
```
**Comfortable** : Standard gear freely available

```
● Private shelter, decent food
● Standard equipment (weapons, armor, travel gear)
● Can hire basic services
```
**Well-off** : Quality and convenience

```
● Quality items (masterwork tools, trained symbiotes)
● Can maintain a base of operations
● Can commission custom work
● Can afford passage on established routes
```
**Wealthy** : Rare and powerful resources

```
● Exotic specimens, magical components
● Multiple bases or mobile headquarters
● Can hire specialists
● Can fund expeditions
```
Complete major quests, find lucrative trade or gain wealthy patrons to improve your wealth.
Live above your means, fall into disgrace or get robbed and you lose it.


# Flux


## Flux

All planets have a flux cycle - impacting biology and magic alike. The cycles are different and
yet connected. Working against the Flux is just as deadly as working with it empowering.

Besides environmental changes that influence everything from travelling to social structure,
the flux also influences the Weave and Symbiosis skills directly.

##### The Four Phases

**Calm**

```
● The universe rests
● Systems operate predictably but with reduced energy
● The safest time, but also the least dynamic
```
**Rising**

```
● The universe stirring to wakefulness
● Risk and reward both increase
● Hidden possibilities begin to emerge
```
**Peak**

```
● Extreme effects dominate
● Impossible becomes possible
● Normal becomes dangerous
```
**Falling**

```
● Systems break down unpredictably
● Chaos creates unexpected openings
● Desperation drives innovation
● The universe exhausting itself
```
##### Tracking

Each world maintains its own Flux track, moving along the track every day.

```
● Typically 4-20 segments long
● Peak and Falling are usually a single segment
● Calm is often the longest phase
```
When cosmic events shake reality, the flux cycle can stall or slip. This is always telegraphed.


# Circle of Life


## Circle of Life

#### Passing of Time

At the end of a session, the table can decide that a Season or a Generation passes.

##### Season

The ritual of a passing season reflects on what happened and how it influences the future.

1: The Telling

The table together narrates the remaining events of the season. The group gathers
Specimen and social connections as appropriate.

**You gain a new Ability. If it’s the end of a year you also gain a new Skillpoint.**

2: The Reckoning

**Social Decay**

```
● Clean connections lose 1 point (minimum 0)
● Pressured connections lose 2 points (flip negative at 0)
● Dirty connections roll d6: 1-2 = exposed and flip negative
● Players narrate how neglected relationships withered
```
**Specimen Degradation**

```
● All specimens degrade one category (unless perfectly preserved)
```
**Equipment cycles**

```
● Dormant items check for reawakening
● Active items check for dormancy
```
**Base Seasonal Needs**

```
● Feeding requirement : 3-5 specimens of appropriate type
● Mood check : Roll d6
○ 1-2: Discontent (one capability dormant next season)
○ 3-4: Neutral (functions normally)
○ 5-6: Thriving (temporary bonus capability)
● If it’s the end of a year: Add a capability
● Describe how the base has grown/changed
```
3: The Turning


At the beginning of the next session, the GM introduces how the world changed:

```
● The current state of the Flux
● Major NPC plans advance or conclude
● Political situations shift
● New opportunities or threats emerge
● Travel routes move
● Seasonal events begin (migrations, blooms, dormancies)
```
##### Generation

**Social connections:** The table together narrates how the groups connections interact with
the world at large, completely changing their social network

**Specimen Degradation:** All specimens that are not perfectly preserved are gone and
replaced with a similar amount and quality of completely different specimen

**Skill progression:**

```
● You may swap out abilities to different ones you have learned in the intervening time
● You may redistribute 3 skill points (but cannot reduce anything below 1)
```
**Base evolution:** The table together narrates how the base interacts with the world at large
and evolves over time, completely changing it.

Aging

You age one bracket. Describe the physical changes. Your capabilities change with you:

```
● Youth → Adult: Gain 1 to any skill
● Adult → Mature: +1 Mind limit, -1 Body limit
● Mature → Elder: +1 to knowledge, -1 to all Body-involving skills, consider retirement
```
#### Retirement

When characters reach narrative completion or become too scarred/aged:

**The Retirement Ceremony** :

1. Player narrates their character's final testimony
2. Character becomes NPC, remaining in the world
3. They might provide knowledge, shelter, or quests

#### Death

You are broken. Half of you died, with you feeling every moment of it.


##### Grief

Grieving takes time. You are playing as an unbonded Torrnek or Kemerin while you are
grieving. Discuss with the GM how long it will last. Some Broken-bonded never bond again
and choose retirement.

You lose all skills of the side that died. The remaining skills are reduced by one from the
trauma. Adjust your character and inadequacy.

**Torrnek:**

- Operates on habit and instinct
- Recognizes party as "safe" but may not remember why
- Can fight, build, and work but cannot strategize
- Must be given clear, simple directions
- May wander off if not watched

**Kemerin:**

- Requires care from party (food, warmth, safety)
- Physically helpless (size of a housecat)
- Can cling to party members for transport
- Can observe, speak, and advise

##### Rebonding

When rebonding after grief, distribute 3 skill points across any Skills.
Your new bond partner brings their own background and connections - adjust name,
character and inadequacy


# Base of Operations


## Base of Operations

A place to call home - not built but _cultivated_. Bases are typically massive sedentary
organisms or grown structures that require care and feeding.

The party needs to be at least well-off to start a Base.

#### Base Properties

**Size** : How many people it can shelter

```
● Small (the party)
● Medium (party + hirelings)
● Large (small community)
```
**Capability examples** (gained through feeding/cultivation):

```
● Storage : Extended inventory space, specimen preservation
● Defense : Natural barriers, warning systems
● Comfort : Reduces strain recovery time
● Workshop : Enables complex crafting projects
● Communications : Connection to travel-plants or message systems
● Concealment : Hidden from casual observation
```
#### Maintenance

Bases require regular attention:

```
● Feeding : Monthly specimen investment
● Mood management : For living bases, keeping them content
● Repairs : After attacks or flux events
● Seasonal changes : Some bases hibernate or migrate
```
Neglected bases might:

```
● Refuse entry
● Lose capabilities
● Attract unwanted inhabitants
● Wander off (if mobile)
● Die (becoming a different kind of shelter)
```
#### Base Evolution

Bases can grow through:


```
● Regular feeding with quality specimens
● Successful symbiotic bonding
● Surviving significant events together
● Exposure to unusual Flux patterns
```
This growth is narrative, not mechanical—your base develops personality and quirks that
create story opportunities rather than numerical bonuses.

#### Starting a Base

When the party is interested:

1. Find suitable base organism/structure - work with the GM
2. Establish initial symbiosis - might require specific specimens
3. Name it
4. Choose two initial capabilities
5. Determine its feeding preferences


# Running the game


## Running the game

#### Tracks

Tracks represent extended challenges, ongoing situations, or gradual changes that require
multiple actions to resolve. They create structured pacing for complex tasks while
maintaining tension through visible progress (or deterioration).

##### Basic Track Mechanics

**Creating a Track**

```
● GM determines length (typically 3-10 segments) based on complexity/severity
● Each segment represents meaningful progress or change
● Label endpoints and optionally key middle segments
```
**Advancing Tracks**

```
● Successes advance the track by 1 segment (or more for critical successes)
● Failures might add complications, lose progress, or advance a different track
● Multiple characters can contribute to the same track
● Different segments might require different skills
```
##### Track Types

Standard Tracks

Progress from start to completion. Used for:

```
● Extended projects (crafting, research, construction)
● Journeys and travel
● World events progressing
```
Dual-Sided Tracks

Progress fills from both ends toward the middle. The track advances from the left
(worsening), while successes fill segments from the right (preventing the worst outcomes).
Once the advancing threat meets the filled prevention, further successes reverse the track
leftward.

Used for:

```
● Deteriorating situations (poison, disease, structural collapse)
● Rising threats (mob anger, approaching storm, ritual completion)
● Competitive races (who reaches the goal - in the middle - first)
```

This creates dramatic situations where early intervention prevents disaster, but the threat still
worsens before improving.

##### Track Variations

```
● Branching Points Some tracks split based on approach or outcomes:
● Clock Tracks Advance automatically each scene/rest/day:
● Hidden Tracks Players see effects but not the track itself (or only the steps, but not
the labels):
```
#### Running action scenes

During an action scene, whenever the momentum swings to the GM, they can spotlight an
NPC or Foe they control and have it take a Turn similar to a player action.
Afterwards, they can either give back the Momentum to the Players, or spend a Fear to
Spotlight another NPC or Foe. They can continue spending Fear until they don’t have any
left.

##### Titan Combat: The Telegraph Pattern

Large entities—whether planet-beings, void-swimmers, or ancient colossi—operate on
different time scales than normal creatures. Their attacks are powerful but telegraphed,
creating tactical puzzles rather than reflex challenges. Players must observe, interpret, and
respond to warning signs rather than simply trading blows.

Turn Structure

When running massive entities, offset their actions:

1. **Resolve** the previously telegraphed action
    ○ "The geysers erupt where the cracks appeared last turn"
    ○ Apply consequences to anyone who didn't respond
2. **Telegraph** the next action with clear signs
    ○ "The creature's throat sac begins glowing, pulsing with increasing intensity"
    ○ "Gravity shifts—small rocks start falling upward toward its maw"
    ○ "Its thousand eyes all focus on a single point"
3. **Players act** with full knowledge of what's coming
    ○ Can attempt to disrupt the telegraph
    ○ Can move to safety
    ○ Can exploit the creature's committed action

Telegraph Guidelines

**Make tells obvious** : This isn't about surprising players— **it's about forcing hard choices.**
"Save the civilian or dodge the attack?" “Get a Hit in trying to interrupt or get to safety?”

**Different tells for different attacks** :


```
● Physical attacks: Ground cracks, muscles tense, weight shifts
● Energy attacks: Glowing, humming, temperature changes
● Summoning/calling: Songs, pheromones, vibrations
● Environmental: Weather shifts, gravity flux, time distortion
```
**Disruption possibilities** : Some telegraphs can be interrupted:

```
● Attacking the glowing throat sac
● Blocking the summoning call
● Destroying the focusing crystal
● Success might reduce or redirect the attack
```
Scale and Positioning

Large entities often have **zones** rather than single positions. Movement between zones
takes time, creating positioning puzzles.

```
● Head/sensory zone (where it perceives)
● Limbs/appendages (where it strikes)
● Core/body (where it's vulnerable)
● Aura/influence (environmental effects)
```
Example Titan Turn

**The Dormant World-Seed** (a planet-being waking):

_Turn 1_ :

```
● Resolves: (nothing—first turn)
● Telegraphs: Surface cracks appear in geometric patterns
● Players: Investigate, prepare, or flee
```
_Turn 2_ :

```
● Resolves: Crystalline spines erupt from the cracks (damage + difficult terrain)
● Telegraphs: The spines begin resonating, building a harmonic frequency
● Players: Destroy spines, find shelter, or attempt communication
```
_Turn 3_ :

```
● Resolves: Sonic pulse shatters anything crystalline (including equipment)
● Telegraphs: The ground becomes spongy, porous—something rising from beneath
● Players: Escape to solid ground, or prepare to ride whatever emerges
```

# Play examples


## Play examples

#### Navigation/travel: Crossing the Spawning Grounds

_The party needs to cross the Driftseed Plains during spawning season to reach the archive
city. GM creates a 5-segment track._

**Segment 1: The Approach** "The plains ahead pulse with movement. Millions of seedpods
lift and fall in waves."

GM: "Two routes through the spawning grounds:"

```
● A) Follow the Harvester Paths - Well-worn but longer (2 track progress, automatic)
● B) Cut through the active spawning area - Risky but direct (3 track progress,
requires roll)
```
Party chooses B.

**Who can help?**

```
● Torrnek: "I'll use Symbiosis - I know these plants from my inadequacy working the
seed farms"
● Kemerin: "I'll assist with Study - I read about their spawning patterns"
● Sethrem warrior: "Can't help here, saving myself for trouble"
```
Roll: Success! The party times their movement between spawning waves. 3 segments
complete.

**Segment 2: Complication!** "A predator-swarm has been following you, waiting for you to
disturb the seeds."

**Choices:**

```
● A) Outrun them - Physical check, 1 progress but everyone takes strain if failed
● B) Distract with specimens - Symbiosis to release pheromone specimen, 1
progress, lose specimen
● C) Hide until they pass - Physical (stealth approach), no progress but safe
```
Party chooses A. The warrior takes lead with Physical 3, others assist. Roll includes
momentum die - success but momentum shifts!

GM: "You outpace the swarm but stumble into a Tangle Grove - the vines here think you're
fleeing prey."

**Segment 3: The Tangle Grove** Now it's dangerous. The GM spends a fear token.

"The grove is hungry. Thorned vines descend from above."


**Forced challenge:** Must escape the grove

```
● Warrior uses Physical (Force approach) to hack through
● Scholar uses Weave to throw syllables to confuse the plants
● Roll both, need at least one success
```
Both succeed! The Weave success adds unexpected benefit: "The syllables make the vines
bloom prematurely, creating a perfumed path. +1 track progress as bonus."

**Final arrival:** Track complete! "You emerge at the archive city's root-gates, covered in pollen
and thorn-scratches but alive."

#### Dual sided Track: Void Poisoning

(5 segments)

Onset→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→Death

```
Nausea Paralysis
```
**Turn 1** : Poison advances to segment 2 (Nausea). Party rolls Symbiosis to find antidote -
success! Fill "Death" segment from right:

Onset→[X]→[ ]→[ ]→[ ]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 2** : Poison advances to segment 3. Party succeeds again, fill "segment 5":

Onset→[X]→[X]→[ ]→[▓]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 3** : Poison advances to segment 4 (Paralysis) but can't go further. Success now
reverses:

Onset→[X]→[X]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→Death

**Turn 4** : Another success, reverse to segment 2:

Onset→[X]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→[▓]→Death


# Abilities


## Abilities

#### Physically Act Abilities

**Adrenaline Surge** - Once per dangerous scene, clear 2 hits before they convert to strain
when crashing. The body remembers how to push through.

**Momentum Thief** - When you succeed on a Physical roll and momentum would shift, you
can take 2 Body strain instead of 1 to steal an additional die for your next Physical action this
scene.

**Tool Whisperer** - You can use tools in unintended ways. Once per scene, declare an
impossible approach for your equipment (like using a hammer for Finesse). Roll normally.

**Scarred Resilience** - Your overwhelmed threshold increases by 1 for each scar you have.
Pain has become a teacher.

**Kinetic Memory** - When attempting a physical task you've failed before in this adventure,
add an extra die. The body learns through repetition.

**Void Veteran** - Ignore the first Body strain from environmental hazards each scene (vacuum,
toxic air, extreme gravity). Your body has adapted to hostile spaces.

#### Symbiosis Abilities

**Specimen Whisperer** - Once per rest, coax a "failed" specimen collection roll to produce
something unexpected but useful (different tags than declared).

**Rapid Cultivation** - During field crafting, treat your first failed connection roll as a success,
but the creation only lasts until the end of the scene.

**Symbiotic Storage** - Your body has adapted internal pouches. Store one small specimen
(1x1 or 1x2) internally. It never degrades but using it causes 1 Body strain.

**Flux Farmer** - During Peak Flux, you can preserve specimens indefinitely without rolling.
During Falling, you can still collect (at -2 dice).

**Living Toolkit** - Permanently bonded with a tool-creature. Define its specialty
(cutting/adhering/detecting). It doesn't take inventory space but needs feeding (1 specimen
per rest).

**Emergency Synthesis** - Take 2 Body strain to immediately combine two specimens without
rolling. The result is unstable and causes a complication the GM chooses.


#### Socialize Abilities

**Provocateur** - When a social encounter goes badly, gain 2 points in a Dirty connection with
someone present as they reveal more than intended.

**Network Architect** - You can maintain one connection at -1 (owing them) indefinitely without
it being called in, representing your value to them.

**Snippet Hoarder** - You start each session with 1d3 random snippets about NPCs you
haven't met yet. GM provides when you meet them.

**Diplomatic Immunity** - Once per session, invoke a connection you don't have yet. You owe
them 3 points (starting at -3).

**Emotional Equilibrium** - When taking Mind strain from social situations, roll 1d6. On 5-6,
inspire someone present to help without spending connection points.

#### Study Abilities

**Parallel Processing** - Your Mind-side can maintain two Mental Loadouts simultaneously, but
switching between them mid-scene causes 1 Mind strain.

**Living Library** - One of your reference sources is a symbiotic organism. It can answer one
question perfectly per session but requires feeding (specific specimen).

**Pattern Recognition** - When observing, use your Study skill instead of your best applicable
skill. You see data where others see chaos.

**Exhaustion Vampire** - When collaborating on research, you can shift your exhaustion boxes
to willing partners (representing mental load sharing).

**Speed Reader** - You can do a Quick Scan on any text-based clue instantly, even in
dangerous situations. This includes syllabic inscriptions and biological patterns.

#### Weave Abilities

**Syllable Sanctuary** - You have an innate syllable embedded in your being. Choose one.
Add it to every spell but gain a permanent physical mark.

**Flux Rider** - During Peak, your spells can affect one additional target. During Falling, you
can cast normally by taking 1 Mind strain per spell.

**Poem Stretcher** - Once per rest, wildly reinterpret a spell's poem without rolling. It works,
but syllables leak causing minor chaos for a full scene.

**Metamagic Memory** - You can hold one spell indefinitely between rests without strain. It
becomes part of your identity.


**Syllabic Immune System** - When a spell would affect you, spend 1 Mind strain to steal one
syllable from it, disrupting the effect and gaining the syllable temporarily.

**Emergency Weaver** - You can create spells without syllable embodiments by taking 1 Body
strain per syllable, pulling patterns from your own life force.

#### Generic Abilities

**Bonded Dysfunction** - Your Mind and Body sides can act independently in emergencies.
Split your dice pool but take two actions. Both must succeed or both fail.

**I Know A Guy** - Start with 3 points in a connection you can define when you first use it.
They're weird, though.

**Void Touched** - You've been exposed to raw Aether. You can sense disruptions in space
(hidden passages, approaching void-swimmers, reality tears).

**Cultural Chameleon** - You can fake being from any culture you've spent a rest observing.
Lasts until you fail a check or someone from that culture tests you.

**Desperation Protocol** - When both strain tracks are at limit-1, you can succeed at any
single roll automatically but immediately shut down one side after.

**Scar Reader** - You can read someone's scars (physical and mental) like a history book.
Learn one truth about their past trauma per scar visible.

**Flux Battery** - You can store the current Flux phase within yourself. Release it later to create
a bubble of that phase for one scene.

**Companion Empath** - Your connection to the group's companion creature is profound. It
gains +2 strain limit and you always know its emotional state.


# Setting


## Title

Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds: A Crude Rendering of Thren

### Core Concept and Tone

This setting presents a cosmos observed through the lens of natural history and
anthropological study, where the fantastical elements emerge from careful observation rather
than arbitrary construction. The universe consists of countless small planets—ranging from a
few meters to several kilometers in diameter—connected by gravity-defying plant life and
inhabited by beings of vastly different scales. The world operates on principles of symbiosis,
interconnectedness, and multi-scale existence, creating an environment that feels both alien
and grounded in recognizable biological and ecological patterns.

The setting embraces a naturalist's indifference to suffering and beauty alike. Wonders and
horrors exist not in balance but in whatever proportion they happen to occur. A
void-swimmer's migration song might guide travelers for generations, then cease without
warning when the creature dies, stranding countless souls. A planet-being's yawn might
create a breathable atmosphere; its sneeze might strip one away. These are not morality
tales. They simply are.

The documentary approach extends beyond natural phenomena to encompass the struggles
of civilizations attempting to survive within indifferent systems. Historical records catalog
reasonable decisions that led to catastrophe, brilliant solutions that created worse problems,
and lucky accidents misremembered as wisdom. Leaders face impossible choices with
incomplete information: evacuate before confirming danger or wait and risk annihilation;
maintain critical symbiotic relationships despite generational damage or sever them and
accept immediate collapse. The archives overflow with voting records of councils who chose
wrong despite choosing well.

The setting emphasizes discovery through observation, where phenomena are described as
they might be recorded by field researchers, complete with uncertainties, conflicting theories,
and ongoing discoveries. What appears to be understood often reveals deeper layers of
complexity upon further investigation. A thriving trade route becomes a death trap when
someone discovers the guiding plants were one organism entering dormancy. A stable
alliance collapses when both societies realize their bonding practices are biochemically
incompatible. Knowledge itself becomes a source of both salvation and doom.

The tone invites players to find meaning not in conquering or fixing the universe but in
observing, documenting, and navigating it. Beauty exists—genuinely, purely—but not for
anyone's comfort. Horror exists—viscerally, truly—but not as punishment. Most things exist
in the vast space between, neither beautiful nor horrible but simply present, waiting to be
observed, documented, and survived.

### The Planetary Garden: Cosmological Structure


The universe consists of innumerable small planetary bodies suspended in what scholars
call the Aether—a medium that permits the passage of light and life but remains poorly
understood. These planets range from tiny garden-sized spheres barely capable of
supporting a single family to larger bodies that might hold entire civilizations. Rather than
orbiting distant suns, these worlds are illuminated by much smaller, closer stellar objects that
orbit the planets themselves, creating complex and varied day-night cycles that differ
dramatically between worlds.

Gravity varies significantly between planets, with some exhibiting forces so light that visitors
can leap into orbit, while others possess crushing gravitational fields that compress visitors
to a fraction of their normal height. This gravitational diversity has produced extraordinary
biological variation, with each planet evolving life suited to its particular conditions. Some
creatures have grown large enough to completely engulf their small worlds, turning entire
planets into living organisms where the distinction between geology and biology becomes
meaningless.

The arrangement of planets appears random to casual observation, but long-term studies
suggest patterns that remain just beyond current understanding. Some clusters of planets
maintain relatively stable positions, while others drift through the Aether in patterns that
some scholars claim are migratory rather than orbital. The true nature of planetary
movement remains one of the great mysteries, spawning countless religious and
philosophical interpretations.

### Botanical Bridges: Inter-Planetary Travel

The most remarkable adaptation in this universe belongs to the plant kingdom, which has
evolved multiple methods of overcoming or circumventing gravity—an ability that appears
intrinsically linked to photosynthetic processes. This unique capability has made plants the
primary means of travel between worlds, fundamentally shaping the development of
inter-planetary civilization.

Various plant species employ different mechanisms for traversing the void:

```
● Bridge Vines grow between nearby planets, creating permanent connections that
may take generations to fully establish but provide stable pathways once mature
● Drift Flowers release seed pods that float on poorly understood Aetheric currents,
carrying passengers who can survive inside their protective shells
● Launcher Trees build pressure in specialized chambers before explosively
propelling seed pods—and willing passengers—toward neighboring worlds
● Void Swimmers actively propel themselves through space using unknown biological
processes, functioning as living vessels
```
Animal life, unable to replicate these gravity-defying abilities, has evolved elaborate
symbiotic relationships with traveling plants. Some species have become specialized
passengers, offering benefits like defense, nutrient processing, or navigation assistance in
exchange for transportation. Others cultivate travel-plants carefully, creating living
infrastructure that connects their communities across multiple worlds.


The mechanisms behind plant-based gravity defiance remain incompletely understood.
Current theories suggest a connection to photosynthesis that allows plants to convert light
into more than just chemical energy, possibly interacting with fundamental forces in ways
that animal life cannot replicate. This has led to extensive cultivation programs and careful
study of travel-plants, though attempts to replicate their abilities through purely technological
means have consistently failed.

### The Flux: Universal Rhythm

While each planet maintains its own local environmental patterns, all worlds experience a
phenomenon known as "The Flux"—a rhythm of change that affects atmospheric pressure,
gravitational stability, biological activity, and what practitioners call "arcane density." Each
planet's Flux cycle operates independently, typically completing over periods ranging from
three to twenty local days, though some extreme outliers have been documented.

The Flux phases—Calm, Rise, Peak, and Fall—manifest differently on each world but follow
recognizable patterns:

```
● Calm phases provide stable conditions optimal for most activities
● Rise sees increasing energy and biological activity, with many organisms entering
reproductive or growth phases
● Peak brings extreme conditions that vary by planet—gravitational fluctuations,
atmospheric density changes, or surges in symbiotic activity
● Fall represents a sometimes violent return to baseline, often accompanied by storms
or ecological turnover
```
Recent observations suggest that planetary Flux cycles, while independent, are somehow
interconnected. Certain planets consistently enter complementary phases, creating
temporary windows of stability for inter-planetary travel. Other combinations produce
amplification effects, where the Peak phase of one world seems to trigger or intensify the
Flux of its neighbors. These patterns have proven invaluable for navigation and timing of
journeys, though their underlying cause remains mysterious.

The Flux profoundly influences magical practice, with different phases affecting the behavior
of arcane syllables and the stability of spell constructs.

### Multi-Scale Ecosystem

The varied gravitational fields and planetary sizes have produced an ecosystem of
extraordinary scale diversity. On low-gravity worlds, gossamer beings stretch across
kilometers, their bodies too delicate to survive elsewhere. High-gravity planets produce
dense, compact life forms of incredible strength. Most remarkably, some organisms have
grown to encompass entire planets, blurring the distinction between creature and world.

These planet-encompassing beings present profound challenges to understanding. Are they
conscious? Do the civilizations living on their surfaces constitute parasites, symbionts, or
simply unnoticed inhabitants? Some planets thought to be geological have revealed


themselves to be dormant organisms, while others assumed to be living have proven to be
elaborate mineral formations created by long-extinct life.

The scale differentials create complex ecological relationships. What appears as weather to
smaller beings might be the breathing of a continental organism. Migrations of mega-fauna
can reshape planetary surfaces, forcing smaller species to adapt or relocate. Some
sophisticated civilizations have developed methods of communicating across scale barriers,
though such interactions remain difficult and often dangerous.

This multi-scale reality has profound implications for navigation and exploration. Travelers
might not realize they've landed on a living being until they notice patterns in what they
assumed was terrain. Some planets that appear dead from afar reveal themselves to be
teeming with microscopic civilizations upon closer inspection. The documentary approach to
understanding these scales means that even well-traveled routes may hide surprises for
those who observe carefully.

### Symbiotic Foundation

Survival in this universe depends fundamentally on symbiotic relationships. The inability of
animal life to independently traverse space has created elaborate inter-species partnerships
that define all aspects of technology and society. These relationships range from simple
biological mutualisms to complex cultivated partnerships developed over generations.

Technology emerges primarily from biological sources and symbiotic cooperation:

```
● Living Tools grown from specially cultivated organisms that respond to their
handler's needs
● Architectural Symbionts that construct and maintain buildings in exchange for
nutrients and care
● Atmospheric Processors that enable survival in void spaces or hostile
environments
● Navigation Specialists that sense routes between worlds through various biological
mechanisms
```
Different societies have developed distinct approaches to symbiosis. Some maintain rigid
hierarchies based on the rarity and power of an individual's symbiotic partners. Others
operate as collective organisms where the boundaries between species become increasingly
blurred over time. Professional specialization often revolves around maintaining relationships
with particular species or developing new forms of cooperation.

The sophistication of symbiotic relationships varies dramatically. Rural communities might
depend on a few essential partnerships, while advanced civilizations orchestrate
symphonies of inter-species cooperation. The loss of key symbiotic species can doom entire
settlements, making the protection and cultivation of partner organisms a primary concern
for most societies.

### The Taboo of Fire


Fire represents the fundamental taboo across nearly all known civilizations, though the full
complexity of reasons has been culturally flattened into simple prohibition over generations.
Children learn that fire brings disaster before they understand why, and most adults couldn't
articulate all the underlying causes—they simply know it is forbidden, dangerous, and
morally wrong.

The taboo stems from multiple overlapping truths, each sufficient to justify the prohibition:

###### The Anti-Symbiotic Nature

Fire represents pure consumption without reciprocity—it takes and gives nothing back. In a
universe built entirely on mutual dependence and symbiotic exchange, fire is philosophically
abhorrent, a form of existence that violates the fundamental compact holding all society
together. Those who use fire often find themselves unable to form the deep symbiotic bonds
necessary for survival, as partner organisms instinctively recoil from the scent of burning.

###### Syllabic Disruption

Fire creates catastrophic interference in the syllabic patterns that enable magic. Like static
corrupting a signal, flame generates noise that can shatter carefully maintained spell-poems,
releasing syllables in dangerous and unpredictable ways. Areas where fire has burned
become magical dead zones or, worse, chaotic zones where syllables behave erratically.
The corruption particularly affects Pyr, the syllable of warmth and glow—true fire might be
what happens when Pyr escapes control entirely.

###### Aetheric Combustion

The Aether itself—the medium between worlds—has varying density and composition.
Under certain conditions, particularly during specific Flux phases or in dense pockets, the
Aether becomes volatile. A small flame can cascade into a conflagration that consumes the
very atmosphere between worlds, destroying breathable air along travel routes and leaving
nothing but deadly void. These conditions are nearly impossible to predict, making any use
of fire a potentially catastrophic gamble.

###### Living World Reactions

Some planet-beings experience fire as pain—burning on their surface like acid on skin.
Others remain indifferent, but determining which response a world will have before lighting a
flame risks triggering anything from mild discomfort to violent convulsions that destroy
settlements. Documented cases exist of entire civilizations being expelled from their worlds
after accidentally causing their planet-being pain through fire use.

###### Historical Catastrophes

The legends speak consistently of fire-born disasters, though details vary by culture. The
Severing of the Garden Worlds, where burning vine-bridges sent a dozen connected planets
drifting apart into the void. The Wake of Ashfall, when a single cookfire allegedly roused a
dormant planet-being to destructive consciousness. The Syllabic Plague, where


fire-corrupted magic spread between worlds like infection. Whether these events happened
as described matters less than their cultural impact.

###### Technological Adaptation

This multi-layered taboo has shaped technological development profoundly. Metalworking
relies on chemical reactions, pressure, or symbiotic organisms that can reshape minerals.
Light comes from bioluminescent organisms, captured stellar radiation, or carefully
contained Pyr syllables. Cooking uses fermentation, chemical processes, or specialized
symbiotic organisms that break down food at the molecular level. Some societies have
forgotten fire entirely, while others maintain knowledge of it as a dire warning.

Different cultures emphasize different aspects of the taboo—some focus on the moral
violation of symbiosis, others on practical dangers, still others on religious implications—but
all agree on the prohibition itself. This creates a universal understanding across otherwise
diverse civilizations: fire is not merely dangerous but fundamentally wrong.

### Magic: The Syllabic Arts

Magic operates through the manipulation of fundamental sound-patterns called
syllables—vibrational constructs that can reshape reality when properly arranged.
Practitioners, known as Weavers or Poets depending on their tradition, create temporary
spell-patterns by combining these syllables into interpretive poems whose effects depend on
both composition and local conditions.

###### Planetary Influences

Some planets amplify certain syllables—water worlds strengthen Mhir, while dense planets
enhance Durn. Void spaces between worlds may cause syllables to leak from poorly
contained spells. These abundances also often indicate the ability to find more and powerful
embodiments of the syllable.

### Player Character Framework: Mind-Body Symbiosis

Player characters belong to a species created by symbiotic bonding. The collective term for
the two individual species plus the bonded form is Vostrani. See the section on them for all
the details.

### The Ambiguity of Divinity

In a universe where planets can be conscious and continent-sized beings reshape worlds
through their daily activities, the distinction between deity and creature becomes
meaninglessly blurred. This fundamental ambiguity shapes all religious and philosophical
thought, creating a cosmos where gods might be verifiably real while simultaneously being
nothing more than very large, very old organisms operating on incomprehensible scales.


###### Living Gods and Divine Creatures

Many beings worshipped as deities are demonstrably real and occasionally responsive.
Planet-beings that react to rituals performed on their surfaces, void-swimmers that seem to
shepherd travelers along specific routes, and massive entities that appear to cultivate
gardens of worlds all exist and can be observed. Yet their divinity remains a matter of
interpretation:

```
● A planet-being responding to prayers might simply be reacting to physical stimuli, like
a dog scratching an itch
● The "divine providence" that saves a settlement could be pure coincidence—they
happened to benefit from a larger being's metabolic process
● Sacred texts describing gods walking between worlds might be historical accounts of
observable mega-fauna migrations
```
This creates a spectrum of theological positions. Literalists maintain that power and scale
equal divinity. Naturalists argue everything is simply biology at different scales. Mystics claim
the distinction itself is false—divinity and biology are one. Each position can point to
evidence, and none can be definitively disproven.

###### Wars of Gods and Scale

Conflicts between massive entities create events that smaller beings invariably interpret
through religious frameworks. When two planet-beings compete for resources, entire
civilizations experience divine judgment. When void-dwelling mega-predators hunt, worlds
experience apocalypse. These events shape religious narratives for generations:

```
● The "Sundering of the Twin Worlds" (two planets colliding) becomes a cautionary tale
about divine wrath
● The "Season of Wandering" (gravitational disruption from a passing giant) transforms
into an exodus myth
● The "Blessed Symbiosis" (successful merger of two planet-beings) becomes a
sacred marriage narrative
```
What makes these interpretations particularly complex is that the entities involved might
actually be aware of and responding to worship, even if their understanding of it differs
completely from their worshippers' intentions. A planet-being might preserve certain areas
because it enjoys the sensation of rituals performed there, without any comprehension of the
theological significance its worshippers attach to this preservation.

###### Theological Conflicts and Evidence

Religious disputes take on new dimensions when gods might literally exist but their nature
remains uncertain:

```
● Incarnationists believe they've identified which specific beings embody their deities
and organize pilgrimages to make contact
● Abstractionists maintain that true divinity transcends physical beings, which are
merely vessels or shadows
```

```
● Pantheists argue the entire connected system of worlds and Flux represents a
singular divine entity
● Atheists insist that no matter how large or powerful, a biological entity cannot be
truly divine
```
These positions create practical conflicts. If a religion identifies a specific void-swimmer as
their deity, should trade routes be redirected to avoid disturbing it? If a planet is deemed
sacred, can its resources be harvested? When two planet-beings conflict, which side
represents divine will?

###### Practical Divinity

The observable existence of immensely powerful beings creates unique religious practices:

```
● Empirical Theology : Priests who study behavioral patterns of supposed deities to
predict their actions
● Diplomatic Prayer : Attempts to establish actual communication with verified divine
entities
● Evolutionary Worship : Religions that openly acknowledge their gods as biological
entities but maintain this doesn't diminish their divinity
● Reciprocal Faiths : Belief systems based on genuine symbiotic relationships with
massive entities
```
Some societies have developed sophisticated protocols for interacting with beings of
ambiguous divinity. They might perform rituals that definitely please a planet-being while
debating whether they're worshipping a god or simply maintaining good relations with their
living environment.

### Cultural and Religious Diversity

The impossible astronomy and mysterious connections between worlds have spawned
countless belief systems, each attempting to explain the nature of existence:

###### Competing Cosmologies

Different cultures offer wildly varying explanations for observable phenomena:

```
● The Gardeners believe the universe is a vast cultivation project by incomprehensible
beings
● The Dreamers claim all planets are thoughts in the mind of a sleeping god
● The Cyclists see the Flux as evidence of universal metabolism
● The Seeders maintain that planets are eggs that will eventually hatch
● The Weavers interpret the inter-planetary connections as a vast web of
consciousness
```
###### Pilgrimage and Sacred Worlds


Certain planets have acquired religious significance, becoming destinations for pilgrims
seeking enlightenment, healing, or communion with supposed divine forces. Some worlds
are considered sacred to specific deities, while others are quarantined as cursed or
dangerous to the spiritual order. The difficulty of reaching certain planets only adds to their
mystique.

###### Navigation as Divine Interpretation

The various methods of inter-planetary navigation often carry religious significance. Reading
plant-growth patterns becomes a form of divination. The songs of navigation creatures are
interpreted as divine hymns. Even practical travel takes on ritual significance when crossing
between worlds dedicated to different deities.

### Gameplay and Narrative Implications

This setting supports multiple layers of discovery and revelation:

###### The Unfolding Universe

Campaigns can begin on isolated worlds where inter-planetary travel is forgotten or
mythological. Early adventures involve local mysteries that later reveal themselves as
symptoms of larger cosmic patterns. That seasonal migration of walking mountains? They're
following gravitational tides between planets. Those ancient root systems that lead
nowhere? They're dormant travel-plants waiting for proper activation.

###### Progressive Understanding

As characters explore, they uncover deeper truths:

1. Initial discovery that other worlds exist
2. Recognition that the Flux connects across planets
3. Understanding that some planets are living beings
4. Realization that observed patterns suggest even larger organizations
5. Confrontation with the possibility that their entire universe might itself be a living
    system

###### Dynamic Challenges

The combination of independent Flux cycles, multi-scale ecosystems, and living planets
ensures that no location remains static. Today's safe harbor might be tomorrow's predator.
Established trade routes can become impassable when symbiotic plants enter dormancy.
The documentary approach means that even experienced travelers can encounter surprises.

###### Cultural Navigation

Different societies' approaches to navigation, symbiosis, and magic create natural conflicts
and opportunities for cooperation. A party might need to negotiate with multiple cultures to


gather the diverse skills needed for a complex journey. Understanding local interpretations of
magic and symbiosis becomes as important as combat prowess.

This setting encourages collaborative world-building where players contribute to the
understanding and development of the universe through their characters' observations and
experiences, making each campaign a shared exploration rather than a predetermined story.
The documentary tone ensures that there's always another layer to discover, another
perspective to consider, and another mystery to investigate.

### Setting Title Reference

###### The Name Itself

**Thren**

```
● What the inhabitants call their cosmos
● Ancient, fundamental word worn smooth by millennia of use
● Every child knows this word before they can walk
● Possibly once much longer, eroded down to its essential syllable
● Encompasses everything: the worlds, the void between, the connections, the living
planets, all of it
```
**The Aethermere**

```
● The outsider's attempt to translate/understand Thren
● Suggests both "Aether" (the medium between worlds) and "mere" (sea/lake)
● Also carries "merely" - this vast everything that might be merely something else's
droplet
● The elaborate phrase needed to approximate what they capture in one syllable
```
###### The Structure

**"Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds"**

```
● Poetic, sprawling, trying to capture something ineffable
● Evokes the image of space itself becoming dense with planetary bodies
● Suggests organic growth rather than mechanical placement
```
**"A Crude Rendering"**

```
● Admits the violence done to the concept in translation
● More honest than "imperfect" or "incomplete"
● Suggests both linguistic translation and artistic sketch
```
###### Tonal Purpose

The unwieldy length becomes a feature:


```
● Players will naturally shorten it differently
● Suggests the impossibility of capturing the totality
● Documentary feel of observers who keep discovering they understood less than they
thought
● Bold, poetic, slightly tragic rather than humorous
● Sets expectation that this is observed from outside, never fully understood
```
###### Practical Usage

```
● Full formal title : Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds: A Crude
Rendering of Thren
● Common abbreviations players might use : "Thren," "The Aethermere," "Thick
With Worlds"
● In-world scholarly references : Might cite it as "Crude Rendering" or "the Thren
documentation"
```

# Intro


**_The Vertebrae Steps_**

Old Geth breathes, and the market breathes with it—awnings unfurling with each honeyed
exhale, collapsing with the mulch-thick inhale. Three generations of traders learning the
city-creature's rhythm, dancing to it. You pass Torrnek workers sorting pods into Old Geth’s
feeding mouths with practiced devotion, pretending not to notice what everyone sees:
Kelitch's Garden dying in the sky above. Yesterday's forests now consumed by black
growths like fungus, creeping ever closer to the bridge-vine's root.

Geth’s ancient flesh flinches beneath you. You steady yourself, catching a trader's eye—her
face confirming what your soles already know. Far below, in cavities never walked, Geth's
oldest tendons - wrapping this barren world since memory began - are loosening from
stone..


# Vostrani


## Vostrani

### Overview

The dominant sapient species of the Symbiotic Realms exists in three distinct forms:
unbonded Bodies, unbonded Minds, and bonded pairs. This triadic society represents one of
the universe's most complex social organisms, where conscious choice determines whether
individuals remain in their birth state or merge with another to become something
fundamentally new. The species embodies the world's central theme of symbiosis not
through necessity but through opportunity—each state being complete yet limited, functional
yet yearning for the possibilities that union brings.

### The Three States of Being

###### Unbonded Bodies

Bodies are fully functional sapient beings who experience the world through immediacy and
action. Standing humanoids, their skin ranges across earth tones and deeper hues, often
marked with natural patterns that identify family lineages.

Bodies possess practical intelligence focused on the immediate and tangible. They excel at
crafts, construction, agriculture, and all forms of physical labor. Their memory spans weeks
rather than years, making them masters of routine and practice but struggling with long-term
planning or abstract reasoning. They experience emotions deeply but simply—joy, sadness,
anger, and love uncomplicated by overthinking or anxiety about the future.

Their communities value action, tradition, and the rhythm of daily life. Without Minds, Bodies
cannot perceive or manipulate syllabic magic, nor can they grasp complex mathematics or
philosophical concepts. Yet they build, farm, craft, and maintain the physical infrastructure
that allows civilization to exist. They speak in simple languages focused on the concrete and
present, rich in words for textures, movements, and immediate sensations but lacking terms
for abstract concepts or future conditionals.

###### Unbonded Minds

Minds exist as smaller creatures, roughly the size of a housecat, with skin resembling
smooth leather or tree bark—never furry, but textured in ways that provide grip and
protection. Their most prominent features are large, complex eyes capable of perceiving
multiple light spectra, and a body designed for clinging and climbing with six delicate limbs.
Along one side of their body run smooth, warm contact surfaces—areas where neural
connection with a Body can occur.

Without Bodies, Minds depend on communal symbiosis for survival. Mind colonies often
attach themselves to Body settlements, providing planning and problem-solving in exchange
for protection and resources. They might orchestrate crop rotations the Bodies follow by


tradition, or design building improvements the Bodies construct without understanding the
underlying principles. Some Minds partner temporarily with animals or plants for mobility and
manipulation. Others "ride along" with bonded pairs as observers and advisors, experiencing
the world secondhand while contributing their thoughts and perceptions.

Minds perceive patterns, connections, and abstractions that Bodies cannot grasp. They
understand the flow of syllabic energy, the mathematical relationships between phenomena,
and the long chains of cause and effect that shape the future. Yet without Bodies, they
struggle with emotional regulation, physical causality, and the immediate consequences of
actions. They can plan elaborate schemes but not understand why hunger hurts. They can
compose symphonies in their thoughts but not comprehend the physical joy of dancing.

###### Bonded Pairs

When a Mind and Body choose to bond—typically during adolescence though sometimes
later—they create something neither could achieve alone. The bonding process takes
several days of gradual synchronization as neural pathways align and consciousness
merges. The Mind positions itself asymmetrically along one shoulder and arm, its contact
surfaces interfacing with corresponding points along the Body's shoulder blade and upper
arm. This creates the distinctive lopsided silhouette that marks bonded individuals.

The bonded consciousness experiences both immediate reality and abstract patterns
simultaneously. They can feel the joy of movement while understanding the physics behind
it. They perceive syllabic energy and manipulate it through combined will and action.
Memory extends from the Body's present-focused experience to encompass years of the
Mind's accumulated knowledge, though early memories from before bonding often feel
dreamlike and disconnected.

The asymmetric bond creates functional differentiation: the "Mind side" gains enhanced
sensitivity and magical manipulation, while the "Body side" retains full native strength and
proprioception. This often influences tool use and combat styles, with the Mind side handling
delicate work while the Body side provides power and stability.

Bonded pairs often serve as bridges between the two unbonded communities, translating
abstract plans into concrete actions, or explaining physical necessities in terms of long-term
consequences. They alone can work complex magic, combining the Mind's perception of
syllables with the Body's ability to ground and channel the energy.

### Daily Life of the Bonded

**The Unity of Self**

A bonded Sethrem is not two beings in cooperation—they are one person whose biology
spans two original forms. The neural bonding creates unified consciousness as surely as
your left and right hemispheres create your singular self. The Mind and Body are not
"partners" or "rider and mount" but aspects of one integrated organism. This distinction
matters: the alienness of Sethrem isn't in how they think about themselves, but in how they
came to be.


**Nutrition and Metabolism**

The Body handles bulk caloric intake through standard humanoid eating. Through the neural
interface, most nutrients transfer directly to the Mind, making separate feeding unnecessary.
However, the Mind's metabolism occasionally requires specific compounds—trace minerals,
certain proteins—that the Body's diet doesn't prioritize. Most Sethrem households keep
small supplies of the Mind's preferred supplements: copper-rich beetles, phosphorus-heavy
nuts, or mineral pastes applied directly to the Mind's mouth. This isn't "feeding the Mind
separately" but ensuring the whole self gets what it needs—no different than a human taking
iron supplements.

**Sleep and Awareness**

Consciousness sleeps as one. The Mind doesn't maintain a separate sleep cycle or remain
awake while the Body rests. The shared sleep means dreams blend both perspective types:
spatial-immediate imagery from the Body's processing, pattern-abstract imagery from the
Mind's. Sethrem often report dreams that feel simultaneously like running through a forest
and understanding the mathematical relationships between the trees.

**Speech and Expression**

Bonded pairs speak with unified intent through the Body's voice. The Mind's vocal
apparatus—smaller, more precise—typically adds emotional coloring: agreement chirps,
skeptical sounds, warning trills that layer over spoken words like human tonal variation. This
creates rich vocal expression that outsiders sometimes find difficult to read.

In specific contexts, pairs can deliberately split into two simultaneous voices—addressing
mixed Torrnek/Kemerin audiences, or expressing genuine internal conflict. This dual-voice is
unusual enough to draw attention and is considered either impressive or unsettling
depending on cultural context.

**Movement and Proprioception**

The bonding process creates shared body-awareness across both forms. During bonding,
four of the Mind's six limbs wrap around the Body's shoulder and upper arm, their delicate
grip becoming the physical anchoring while their inner surfaces form the neural interface
points. These limbs remain permanently positioned—not paralyzed, but integrated into the
junction structure itself.

The Mind's remaining two limbs stay free, extending from the bonded mass with full mobility.
Though shorter and weaker than the Body's arms, they offer remarkable fine motor
control—perfect for delicate manipulation, precision work, or gestural emphasis.
Proprioception extends seamlessly across all four limbs (two Body, two Mind), coordinating
without conscious effort.

This unified proprioception explains why bond-breaking is so traumatic. Losing the bond isn't
like losing a partner—it's like losing limbs, senses, and memories simultaneously. The
remaining self is genuinely incomplete in ways that go beyond emotional loss.


The visual result is distinctive: the Mind's body conforming to the shoulder with four limbs
wrapped in permanent embrace, two smaller arms extending forward, and the Mind's head
positioned over the shoulder providing a second viewpoint. The "leaning ones" silhouette
that gave them their taxonomical name.

**Junction Maintenance**

The neural interface points require regular care, similar to wound maintenance or caring for
sensitive skin. Specialized oils keep the connection healthy, preventing inflammation or
infection. Most cultures produce these oils locally, and junction-care is simply part of daily
hygiene—no more remarkable than brushing teeth or cleaning ears.

The junction can become strained through overexertion, creating localized pain that affects
both sides of the bond. Bone-setters and healers who specialize in junction care exist in
most settlements of any size.

### The Bonding Choice

Coming-of-age bonding represents one of the most significant decisions in an individual's
life. Unlike the historical necessity of infant bonding in ancient times, modern society allows
Bodies and Minds to mature independently before choosing whether to merge.

Different cultures approach bonding differently. Some hold elaborate festivals where young
Minds and Bodies meet and test compatibility through shared tasks and conversations.
Others use careful matchmaking based on complementary traits and family histories. Still
others believe in spontaneous bonding—that Minds and Bodies will recognize their ideal
partners instinctively.

The choice to bond is irreversible under normal circumstances. The gradual neural fusion
permanently alters both beings' consciousness patterns. Some individuals choose never to
bond, remaining in their birth state throughout their lives. These "eternally unbonded" may
be viewed with respect, pity, or suspicion depending on cultural context.

Compatibility varies widely. Some pairings produce harmonious unions where both aspects
blend seamlessly. Others result in internal tension, with the Mind and Body aspects of the
bonded pair pulling in different directions. The most successful bonds often occur between
individuals who knew each other before bonding and chose union from a place of mutual
understanding rather than societal pressure.

### Player Character Background: The Bond-Broken

Player characters represent a rare and traumatic category: those who have been forcibly
separated and emergency re-bonded with their original partner. This violent disruption and
reconstitution explains both their "newness" to the world and their potential for growth and
change.

###### The Traumatic Separation


Various catastrophes can forcibly sever a bond:

```
● Exposure to corrupted syllabic energy that disrupts neural connections
● Rare toxins or diseases that target the bonding interface
● Extreme physical trauma that damages the neural connection points
● Poorly executed magical experiments or failed attempts at grand magic
```
The separation is agonizing. The Mind experiences sensory deprivation and cognitive
dissolution as abstract thought becomes impossible without the Body's grounding. The Body
suffers immediate memory loss, retaining only the past few weeks while losing all context for
their actions and relationships. Both halves recognize each other but cannot fully remember
who they were together.

###### Emergency Re-bonding

Re-bonding must occur within days or both halves will die. The process is rushed,
desperate, and imperfect. Instead of the gradual synchronization of first bonding, the neural
pathways forge new connections wherever they can, creating a similar but fundamentally
altered consciousness.

The new bond forms different patterns than the original. Skills once second nature now feel
foreign. Most memories are lost. Some memories survive, but feel like watching another
person's life. The personality remains fundamentally the same but expressed differently.

###### Social Status

"Bond-broken" pairs occupy a unique social position. They're viewed with a mixture of
sympathy, curiosity, and unease. Some cultures see them as touched by fate, marked for
either greatness or tragedy. Others consider them fundamentally unreliable, their altered
bonds making them unpredictable.

The bond-broken often struggle with identity questions. Are they the same person they were
before? Do old relationships and obligations still apply? Most eventually accept that they are
both their old selves and someone new—a perspective that can be either liberating or deeply
unsettling.

### Physical Design

###### Visual Characteristics

**Bodies** are humanoid but with clear non-human features. Their skin has a subtle texture
reminiscent of tree bark or river stones, with natural patterns that are unique to individuals
but similar within family lines. The neural interface points appear as slightly raised areas
along one shoulder blade and upper arm, resembling natural armor plating or deliberate
scarification rather than ports or wounds.

**Minds** are compact creatures with six limbs designed for climbing and clinging. Their skin
has a leather-like or bark-like texture that provides grip without fur or scales. The large eyes


dominate their faces, capable of independent movement like a chameleon's. Along one side
of their body, the skin is smoother and warmer—the contact surface for bonding. When not
bonded, they move with quick, precise movements, using their multiple limbs to navigate
three-dimensional spaces with ease.

**Bonded pairs** have a distinctive asymmetric silhouette. The Mind wraps along one shoulder
and upper arm, its body conforming to the Body's musculature. The Mind's head extends
forward over that shoulder, providing a second viewpoint and expanded peripheral vision.
The bonded side appears bulkier but also more elaborate, often decorated with clothing or
armor that emphasizes rather than hides the union.

###### Cultural Variations

Different societies emphasize different aspects of the bond through decoration and
modification:

```
● Some paint elaborate patterns that flow from Body to Mind, emphasizing their unity
● Others use contrasting decorations to celebrate the distinct natures being joined
● Certain cultures practice scarification or tattooing that only makes sense when the
pair bonds
● Military groups might armor the bonded side heavily while keeping the Body side
mobile
```
### Societal Structures

###### Economic Specialization

The triadic nature of society creates natural economic specialization:

```
● Bodies dominate physical industries: construction, agriculture, crafts, transportation
● Minds excel in planning, design, theoretical work, and pattern analysis
● Bonded pairs bridge both worlds: architecture, complex engineering, magical
practices, leadership
```
This creates interdependence rather than hierarchy. A Body farmer needs Mind-designed
rotation patterns to maintain soil health. A Mind architect needs Body builders to realize their
designs. Bonded pairs coordinate between both groups, translating abstract plans into
practical action.

###### Political Systems

Governance varies widely between cultures:

```
● Some societies maintain three separate councils (Body, Mind, and Bonded) that must
reach consensus
● Others rotate leadership between the three states on regular cycles
● Certain cultures restrict political participation to bonded pairs, viewing them as the
only "complete" citizens
```

```
● A few radical societies are governed entirely by one state, though these tend toward
instability
```
###### Family Structures

Reproduction complicates social relationships. Bodies reproduce with Bodies, Minds with
Minds, but bonded pairs raise children of both species together. This creates extended
family networks where biological and bond relationships interweave:

```
● A bonded pair might raise their Body's biological offspring alongside their Mind's
● Unbonded relatives often help raise children of their own species
● Some cultures practice communal child-rearing where the entire community shares
responsibility
● Others maintain strict separation between Body and Mind children until bonding age
```
###### Religious and Philosophical Perspectives

The three states inspire diverse theological interpretations:

```
● Unificationists believe bonding represents divine intention, with unbonded beings
incomplete
● Trinitarian faiths celebrate all three states as equally sacred expressions of
existence
● Separatists view bonding as corruption of pure forms, advocating for remaining
unbonded
● Cyclic philosophies propose that souls experience all three states across multiple
lifetimes
```
### Gameplay Implications

###### Character Creation

Players create both halves of their bond-broken pair, choosing:

```
● The Body's physical variant (affecting stats and capabilities)
● The Mind's temperament (influencing mental abilities and magical affinity)
● Their original bond nature (how well-synchronized they were before breaking)
● The cause of their bond-breaking (affecting starting situation and contacts)
● Which shoulder the Mind bonds to (affecting handedness and combat style)
```
###### Mechanical Considerations

The asymmetric bond creates tactical choices:

```
● Mind-side actions gain bonuses to precision and magical manipulation
● Body-side actions gain bonuses to strength and durability
● Switching which hand holds a weapon or tool takes conscious effort
● Some abilities require both sides working in concert
```

###### Character Development

As bond-broken pairs adventure, they can:

```
● Recover fragments of their original memories through familiar experiences
● Develop new neural pathways that grant different abilities than their original bond
● Learn to communicate with unbonded members of both species
● Potentially help other bond-broken pairs with their own recovery
```
The trauma of breaking and re-bonding means character growth represents not just gaining
power but rediscovering and redefining identity—a journey that parallels the player's growing
understanding of the game world itself.

### The Vostrani: Complete Naming Reference

###### Species Overview

**VOSTRANI**

```
● The taxonomical name used by outsiders
● Origin: First contact misunderstanding - observers thought the asymmetric posture of
Sethrem was a universal injury or deformity
● Means: "The leaning ones" in the first observer species' language
● Usage: Academic texts, inter-species communication, official documents
● Reception: Varies by culture - some reclaim it with pride, others politely correct to
proper names
```
###### The Three Forms

**TORRNEK** (Bodies)

```
● Etymology: Durn → Durnek → Dorrnek → Torrnek
● Linguistic evolution: -nek suffix meaning "bearer/holder," D→T hardening through
regional dialect
● Character: Heavy double 'r', hard 'k' ending - solid, working-class, unpretentious
● No variants in modern use - the term is universal and stable
```
**KEMERIN / QEMERIN** (Minds)

```
● Etymology: Qem → Qemerin → Kemerin
● Two forms in modern use:
○ Qemerin
■ formal, scholarly, used in written texts and by intellectuals asserting
heritage
○ Kemerin
■ everyday speech, common usage
● Character: Flowing, delicate -in ending, lighter consonants suggesting fragility
```

**SETHREM** (Bonded)

```
● Etymology: Keth → Keth-tharan → Kethrem → Sethrem
● Historical evolution:
○ Keth-tharan (ancient): "threshold-crossers" - literal, when bonding was
new/taboo
○ Kethrem (classical): legal texts, epic poems about first voluntary bonds
○ Sethrem (middle period-present): K→S shift after fire catastrophes, distancing
from sacred syllable
● Modern variants:
○ Sethremi
■ affectionate diminutive in some regions
○ Sethremek
■ military designation for bonded warriors
○ Sethrem-torn
■ medical term for bond-broken
○ Torn
■ colloquial for bond-broken
```
###### Linguistic Patterns

**Common elements:**

```
● The 'r' sound links all three forms, marking shared linguistic heritage
● Suffixes:
```
**Historical periods reflected in usage:**

```
● Ancient texts: Original syllabic forms and compounds
● Classical period: Softening of consonants, formal suffixes
● Post-fire taboo: Linguistic distancing from sacred syllables
● Modern: Regional variations, professional terminology
```
###### Cultural Usage Notes

```
● The Vostrani themselves primarily use their specific form names or cultural/national
identities
● Using "Vostrani" within their communities varies:
○ Progressive groups may embrace it as unified identity
○ Traditionalists may see it as outsider ignorance
○ Diplomatic contexts use it for inter-species clarity
● Scholarly texts often use both: "The Vostrani (collectively known) comprise three
forms: the Torrnek..."
● The term "Vostrani" immediately reveals the speaker as an outsider or someone
engaged in inter-species dialogue
```
###### Player Reference


When encountering these people:

```
● Vostrani
○ what other species call them (often revealing the speaker's outside
perspective)
● Torrnek/Kemerin/Sethrem
○ what they call themselves (showing cultural knowledge)
● Qemerin vs Kemerin
○ indicates social class or educational background
● Torn
○ rough slang for bond-broken, potentially offensive depending on context
```

## Daily life

**EARLY UNSORTED NOTES**

#### Food

```
● Sap-tap groves - Trees cultivated for their nutrient-rich saps, tapped like maple
syrup but providing complete proteins. Different trees for different seasons.
● Graze meadows - Not for livestock, but for the settlements themselves. Many
communities cultivate patches where their base-creatures can extend feeding tendrils
during rest.
● Egg taxation: taking a percentage of clutches in exchange for protection
● Carrion rights: negotiated access to natural deaths
● Insect farming: but the insects are thumbnail-to-fist sized, not tiny
● Oil pressings - Various seeds and nuts pressed for oils that keep the bonding
surfaces healthy. Applied topically, not consumed.
```
**Mind Food** (complex nutrients for neural function):

```
● Pearl farms - Certain mollusks concentrate minerals essential for Kemerin health.
These aren't eaten but held in the mouth where they slowly dissolve.
● Dream gardens - Specific fungi that must be consumed fresh, within hours of
picking, or they lose their neural-supporting compounds.
```
**Foraging** (the opportunistic approach)

```
● Following the Flux cycles for seasonal bounties
● Quick-growing weeds after planet-being movements
● Collecting overflow from other species' activities
● Requires mobility and observation
```
This creates natural settlement patterns: permanent towns near reliable fungal substrates,
seasonal camps following foraging opportunities, trade posts where negotiations happen.

Most casual meals avoid meat entirely - it's feast food, special occasion food, or emergency
food.

##### Fermentation takes

```
● Fermentation pits - Since fire is taboo, most "cooking" happens through controlled
fermentation. Buried chambers where symbiotic bacteria break down tough plant
matter into digestible paste.
● Fermented protein blocks - meat left in enzyme baths until it becomes something
between jerky and cheese
```

#### Materials

```
● Secretion vessels - Certain domesticated beetles excrete shells that harden into
ceramic-like containers. Fed different minerals for different properties.
● Pressure-formed clay - Using specialized symbiotes that generate intense
pressure/chemical reactions to cure clay
● Living containers - Gourds and pods that are still technically alive, maintaining
themselves if fed occasionally
● Found materials: shed carapaces, naturally occurring mineral formations
● Symbiote fur - Creatures that grow excess fur/down specifically to be harvested, like
sheep but more intentional
```
#### Markets

A typical settlement center isn't neat. It's layers of negotiated space:

**The Pit** - Central fermentation area, always slightly warm, slightly sour-smelling. Different
sections for different processes. Arguments about whose batch is contaminating whose.

**Specimen Rows** - Not shops but more like... tide pools? Collectors maintain small
ecosystems where customers can observe specimens before purchasing. "This one's more
active in the morning." "See how it responds to the Mhir stone?"

**The Pressing Courts** - Open areas with communal oil presses, grain mills (hand-powered),
and other processing equipment. Social spaces where work and gossip mix.

**Memory Corners** - Where Kemerin elders perch, offering recall services. "What was the
recipe for that tonic?" "When did the bridge vines last bloom?" Living libraries, paid in
neural-food.

#### Other species

**Chorus Beetles** (size of housecats):

```
● Maintain fermentation pit temperatures through their songs
● Different pitches for different processes
● Paid in fermentation byproducts they love
● Individual beetles have names, preferences, and can be cranky
```
**Porter Sloths** (bear-sized, six-limbed):

```
● Extremely slow but can carry enormous loads
● Their backs develop custom-shaped depressions for regular loads
● Form decades-long relationships with specific families
● Actually more intelligent than they appear - just operating on different timescales
```
**Shade Dancers** (delicate, butterfly-like):


```
● Provide mobile shade in exchange for nectar-foods
● Swarm patterns indicate weather changes
● Some settlements train them for message-carrying
● Considered half-pet, half-employee
```
#### Rhythm

Morning:

```
● Torrnek check the fermentation pits (overnight processes)
● Kemerin review the settlement's needs, plan the day
● Sethrem coordinate between the two groups
```
Midday:

```
● Specimen gathering while they're active
● Market activity peaks
● Chorus beetles most active (warmest)
```
Evening:

```
● Communal oil pressing (social time)
● Porter sloths finally arrive with their morning loads
● Shade dancers return to their roosts
```
### A Typical Settlement

Picture a **market town** built into/around a massive dormant tree-thing:

**The Root Market** (ground level)

```
● Specimen traders with temporary stalls (specimens can't stay long)
● Fermentation sellers with sealed pots
● Molt-collectors displaying processed shells
● Services: syllable readings, minor healing, route planning
```
**The Trunk Chambers** (carved/grown spaces)

```
● Workshop spaces where secretion-ceramics cure
● Communal kitchens with fermentation arrays
● Mind-clusters: shelving where unbonded Kemerin gather
● Storage for things that need darkness/stability
```
**The Canopy Platforms** (seasonal/temporary)

```
● Forager camps during gathering seasons
● Navigator posts watching route conditions
```

```
● Defensive positions (though combat is rare)
```
**The Underground** (root spaces)

```
● Fungal gardens
● Waste processing chambers
● Emergency shelters
● Things that need steady temperature
```
### Daily Rhythms

**Dawn:** The Torrnek wake first, checking overnight fermentations, feeding the ceramic
beetles, maintaining the fungal gardens. Work songs without words - just rhythm.

**Morning:** The Sethrem emerge, coordinating between the Torrnek work and Kemerin
planning. The market opens. Specimen collectors return from dawn gathering.

**Midday:** The Kemerin are fully active, perched throughout the settlement observing,
calculating, planning. This is when complex negotiations happen.

**Afternoon:** Mixed activity - some Torrnek rest while others work, Sethrem handle trade,
Kemerin cluster to share observations.

**Evening:** Communal eating in shifts (Torrnek eat simply and quickly, Sethrem have
elaborate meals, Kemerin nibble constantly but lightly).

**Night:** Torrnek sleep deeply, Kemerin take turns keeping watch, Sethrem often work on
personal projects.

### The Messiness

```
● Different districts follow different Flux timings based on their primary trade
● Water systems are biological and occasionally have moods
● Waste processing sometimes backs up when the organisms get sick
● Property rights are incredibly complex (who owns what when it's all
grown/negotiated?)
● Three separate but overlapping social hierarchies that don't always agree
● Some neighborhoods are literally mobile (growing on moving organisms)
```
Would you like me to dig deeper into any of these? I'm particularly interested in how the
three food pillars might create different "classes" or professional identities in society.

Alright, let's build out the mundane reality of Thren - the stuff that makes a world feel lived-in
rather than designed. I'll work from resource cycles upward to settlement patterns.

### The Foundation: Substrate Farming


Most food comes from **substrate cultivation** - not traditional agriculture but managing the
living surfaces that smaller organisms grow on. Picture terraced pools of specialized
bark-like material that's technically alive, constantly regenerating. Different substrates
support different crops:

```
● Crust gardens : Dense, mineral-rich surfaces that fruit with nodules containing
concentrated nutrients. Harvested by scraping, leaves the substrate scarred but
regenerating.
● Sponge fields : Porous masses that filter nutrients from rain/mist, producing edible
polyps. Torrnek squeeze-harvest these like gathering grapes, but the work is
backbreaking.
● Flow channels : Living gutters that process waste into protein-rich paste organisms.
Not prestigious but essential - every settlement needs its flow-tenders.
```
The substrates themselves need feeding - usually with processed waste, specific minerals,
or Flux-timed exposure to certain light spectra. This creates job specialization:
substrate-singers who maintain the health through vibration, scrapers who harvest without
killing, feeders who maintain the delicate chemical balance.

### Protein and Variety

**Motile food sources** aren't herded exactly, but _negotiated with_ :

```
● Chorus swarms : Insect analogues that return to specific sound patterns.
Communities maintain "chorus stones" that particular swarms recognize as home.
The swarms donate infertile members in exchange for protection during molting.
● Sap-dancers : Creatures that process tree equivalents' sap into honey-like
substances. They're not domesticated but have multi-generational contracts - they
remember which settlements treat them fairly.
● Filterers : Architectural symbionts that clean the air/water and concentrate the filtered
particles into protein blocks as waste. Living in a settlement means eating what your
buildings excrete.
```
The taboo against fire means all cooking is:

```
● Chemical (acid baths that break down proteins)
● Pressure-based (squeezed between specific stones)
● Fermentation (everything fermented, different durations for different effects)
● Symbiotic (organisms that pre-digest food in exchange for portions)
```
### Material Culture

**Ceramics don't exist** - fire taboo. Instead:

```
● Grown shells : Molded while soft from cultivated creatures, then dried and sealed
with resin
```

```
● Pressure-formed minerals : Specific organisms compress mud/clay into stone-like
hardness
● Woven chitin : Shed from various creatures, softened with enzymes, reformed into
shapes
● Living containers : Gourd-like organisms that stay alive, keeping contents fresh
```
**Metals** are rare and valuable:

```
● Extracted by mineral-worms that concentrate ore in their segments
● Shaped through acid etching and pressure rather than forging
● Often grown into shape by feeding metal-eating bacteria in molds
● Considered slightly uncanny - metal doesn't breathe
```
### Settlement Layout

Communities grow organically around **anchor organisms** :

The **Heartwood** (or local equivalent): A massive, sessile creature that provides:

```
● Structural support (buildings grow from its limbs/appendages)
● Waste processing (its roots handle sewage)
● Climate control (its respiration moderates temperature)
● Emergency food (it can sacrifice non-essential parts in crisis)
```
Around this, zones develop naturally:

**The Stems** : Living bridges/roads that are actually the Heartwood's circulation system. Traffic
helps pump nutrients, so major paths develop where the creature needs circulation. Torrnek
runners literally keep the settlement alive by jogging specific routes.

**Pocket Neighborhoods** : Where the Heartwood creates natural hollows. Each pocket
develops its own microclimate and specialty based on what grows well there. The
prestigious pockets get morning light and evening shade; the working pockets deal with
whatever conditions they get.

**The Fringes** : Where independent organisms attach themselves to the Heartwood's edges.
Semi-legal markets, experimental cultivation, recently arrived travelers with their mobile
symbiont-homes. Not quite part of the community but essential for genetic diversity.

### Daily Rhythms

The day structure emerges from biological needs:

**First Circulation** (dawn): Everyone walks/runs the Stems to wake up the Heartwood. It's
both exercise and civic duty. Kemerin ride on Torrnek shoulders or scurry along the upper
bridges.


**Tending Hours** : Checking on substrates, negotiating with food-sources, maintaining the
thousand small symbioses that keep everything running. This is when most work happens.

**Peak Shelter** (varies by Flux): When conditions are harsh, everyone retreats to the
Heartwood's shelter. Social time, trading, education.

**Evening Processing** : The community's various organisms need end-of-day care. Feeding
the filterers, scraping the substrates, singing to the chorus stones.

### Other Species Integration

**Vrex** : Six-limbed climbers (dog-sized) that clean parasites from the Heartwood in exchange
for shelter. They've developed a gift economy with Vostrani - leaving small objects in
exchange for food. Not sapient but close enough that the distinction gets philosophically
messy.

**Goldentongues** : Linguistic symbionts - worm-like creatures that live in throats and translate
between species. Uncomfortable but invaluable for traders. Some families have maintained
the same Goldentongue lineages for generations.

**Carriers** : Various burden-beasts, but none are simply "owned." Each species has different
contract terms:

```
● Stone-backs want specific minerals monthly
● Drift-wings need sung appreciation daily
● Tunnel-makers require rotation between three different settlements to prevent
depression
```
This creates a society where everyone's constantly maintaining relationships - not just with
each other but with the living infrastructure. Miss a feeding and your door might not open.
Neglect the chorus stones and next month's protein fails to arrive.

Would you like me to dig into any particular aspect? I'm curious about developing the actual
sensory experience - what does this world smell/sound like as you move through it?

Alright, let's dig into the texture of daily life. You're right about the balance - it needs to feel
viscerally different but still parseable. Let me work through the resource cycles first, then
build up to how settlements actually feel.

### Food Without Fire

**Primary Sustenance** The foundation is probably **fermentation chambers** - living
organisms that function like communal stomachs. Every household feeds raw materials into
their chamber-beast, which breaks down cellulose, neutralizes toxins, and produces a
nutrient paste. Not appetizing on its own, but:

```
● Different chamber-beasts produce different flavors based on their gut flora
● Families cultivate specific bacterial cultures like sourdough starters
```

```
● The paste can be shaped, dried, or mixed with other ingredients
● Status comes from having multiple chambers for different flavor profiles
```
**Fresh Consumption**

```
● Certain fruits have shells that "cook" their contents through chemical heat when
cracked
● Symbiotic processing: foods that are toxic raw but safe after passing through specific
creatures
● Time-release pods that chemically transform their contents over days
● Social eating where multiple people's saliva enzymes combine to break down shared
foods
```
**Preservation**

```
● Controlled rot/fermentation in specialized vessels (living or mineral)
● Dehydration using hygroscopic organisms
● Suspension in bio-generated resins or gels
● Some foods kept alive but dormant
```
### Material Culture

**Instead of ceramics/metal:**

```
● Grown shells - mollusks cultivated in shaped molds, harvested, cleaned
● Compressed organics - layers of leaves/fibers pressed under massive weight
(maybe gravity manipulation?)
● Secreted resins that harden into glass-like substances
● Induced mineralization - creatures that deposit minerals in specific patterns
● Borrowed bones - negotiations with large creatures for shed materials
```
**The Workshop District** would have:

```
● Pressure chambers (massive creatures that compress materials)
● Growth pools with template molds
● Curing tunnels where specific atmospheres harden resins
● Negotiation posts where crafters trade with material-producing creatures
```
### Settlement Layout

Picture settlements growing in **orbital rings** around a central base-creature:

```
● The base-creature is too valuable to build directly on
● First ring: maintenance structures, feeding stations
● Second ring: workshops and processing
● Third ring: living quarters
● Outer ring: specimen gardens and defensive symbionts
```

But it's messier than that - some districts grew from failed base-creatures that calcified in
place. Others sprawl along the roots of travel-plants. The wealthy might have mobile
quarters that migrate between rings based on the base-creature's mood.

**Key landmarks everyone would recognize:**

```
● The Feeding Platforms (where the base gets fed communally)
● Chamber Markets (fermentation chamber trading/sampling)
● The Specimen Exchange
● Syllable Halls (where embodiments are stored/traded)
● Navigation Groves (where travel-plants are tended)
● The Purgeworks (where toxins are processed into useful materials)
```
### Daily Rhythms

**Morning:** The base-creature's dawn vocalization wakes everyone. First task is checking
your chamber-beasts and symbionts - did they survive the night? Any sprouting? Any
dormancy shifts?

**Workday:** Torrnek handle physical labor in the morning when they're fresh. Kemerin
colonies coordinate during midday when light is best for their eyes. Sethrem bridge between
both schedules.

**Evening:** Communal feeding of the base-creature - miss too many and you lose standing.
Social time includes specimen trading, fermentation sampling, symbiont grooming.

### Beasts of Burden Equivalents

Rather than single species:

```
● Carrier collectives - swarms that distribute weight among many small creatures
● Motivated plants - vegetation that moves toward specific pheromones, used for slow
transport
● Gradient followers - creatures that always move toward heat/light/moisture, guided
by portable sources
● The Indebted - large creatures that owe favors, providing temporary transport
```
### The Visceral Details

The air always smells faintly of fermentation - yeasty, sour, sometimes sweet. Surfaces are
often slightly warm and yielding (living architecture). There's constant low-level noise from
creatures and symbiont maintenance. Colors tend toward organic - lots of browns, deep
greens, some bioluminescent highlights but never bright flames.

Water systems are visible - root networks, condensation collectors, filtration organisms in
transparent shells. Nothing is ever quite still; even buildings slowly adjust and settle.


Does this hit the right balance of alien but comprehensible? I'm trying to avoid the
"everything is a metaphor for symbiosis" trap while keeping that biological, living quality
throughout.

Alright, let's meander through this! Daily life needs to feel both alien and familiar - like
watching a nature documentary about a real place you've never been.

### Food Systems

The fire taboo is our biggest constraint and most interesting flavor generator. Without
cooking via heat, I'm thinking:

**Fermentation is king** - Every household maintains fermentation vessels with different
bacterial cultures passed down through generations. These aren't just for preservation but
for breaking down proteins and making nutrients bioavailable. Picture ceramics with living
glazes that help process food, getting passed down like sourdough starters. Some families'
vessels have been continuously active for centuries.

**Mechanical/enzymatic "cooking"** - Certain symbiotic organisms act like external
stomachs. You feed raw ingredients to a "processor slug" that pre-digests food with powerful
enzymes. Different species create different flavor profiles - some add umami, others create
sweet notes. The wealthy have rare processors that can create complex textures.

**Solar processing** - On high-UV worlds, food gets "cooked" through controlled exposure
under glass-like biological membranes. Different wavelengths create different chemical
changes. During Peak Flux, certain foods can only be properly processed.

**Diet composition** :

```
● Torrnek prefer dense, fibrous foods they can grind with strong jaws - root vegetables,
tough fungi, aged/dried specimens
● Kemerin need nutrient-dense pastes and jellies they can consume with their smaller
mouths
● Sethrem develop combined preferences, often eating in stages - rough food for the
Body-side satisfaction, refined nutrients for the Mind-side needs
```
### Settlement Layout

Rather than neat city planning, settlements grow organically around **symbiotic
infrastructure** :

**The Fermentation Quarter** - Downwind, always. A maze of vessels, pools, and processing
chambers. The smell is... complex. Torrnek workers maintain the heavy vessels while
Kemerin monitor the bacterial cultures. Social status partly determined by the quality/age of
your family's cultures.

**Living Architecture** - Buildings are cultivated from modified mangrove-like organisms. They
start as seedlings that merge as they grow, guided by wooden frameworks. Takes years to


grow a house, but they're self-repairing and respond to inhabitants' chemical signals.
Abandoned buildings don't decay - they go feral, becoming increasingly maze-like.

**The Specimen Markets** - Not a single location but a network of trading posts connected by
the settlement's "nervous system" - a fungal network that carries chemical messages about
what's available where. Torrnek runners physically carry goods, Kemerin use the network to
negotiate, Sethrem coordinate both.

**Workshop Symbionts** - Different crafts require different organisms:

```
● Ceramic workshops use acid-secreting worms to etch and glaze
● Textile workers partner with silk-producing colonies that respond to touch-patterns
● Metal shaping happens through chemical baths and pressure from specialized
crushing-beetles
```
### Domestic Partners (not pets, not livestock)

**Carrier Beasts** - Like your companion creature but more specialized:

```
● Some are basically walking warehouses with multiple stomachs for storage
● Others are living scaffolding that builders ride up walls
● Transport varieties that can sense Flux patterns and navigate accordingly
```
**Processor Colonies** - Sessile organisms that handle resource transformation:

```
● Waste digesters that produce fertilizer (every household has one)
● Fiber-weavers that turn plant matter into textile base
● Water purifiers that are essentially living filters
```
**Mood Beetles** - Small insects that change color based on chemical signals. Torrnek use
them as crude emotion-readers since they miss subtle cues. Kemerin find them redundant.
Some establishments require you to wear one for "honest dealings."

### Daily Rhythms

Morning routines involve checking on all your symbiotic partners:

```
● Feed the processor slugs
● Rotate the fermentation vessels
● Check if any equipment has gone dormant overnight
● Kemerin review the fungal network overnight messages
● Torrnek do the heavy maintenance
```
The workday depends heavily on current Flux phase:

```
● Calm: Normal productivity, maintenance, planning
● Rising: Specimen gathering, organism breeding, magic preparation
● Peak: Dangerous but profitable activities, magical work, specimen preservation
```

```
● Falling: Indoor work, repairs, social activities, avoiding the chaos
```
### Social Spaces

**Fermentation Halls** - Communal eating spaces where people bring their processed foods.
The mix of smells from different family cultures creates unique atmospheres. Torrnek and
Kemerin often eat separately (different foods) while Sethrem move between both areas.

**Growth Gardens** - Public spaces where the settlement's living architecture is guided and
trained. Children learn to shape growing structures. Couples might cultivate privacy pods
together. It's part playground, part workshop, part art gallery.

**The Chorus Pools** - Water features where acoustic properties let Kemerin communicate in
their high-frequency ranges while Torrnek can feel the vibrations through the water. Natural
gathering spots for mixed groups.

### What This Feels Like

Walking through a settlement, you'd see:

```
● Buildings breathing slightly, their windows dilating with temperature
● Torrnek hauling massive fermentation vessels while Kemerin perch on their
shoulders calling out instructions
● Children racing mood beetles, betting on which will change color first
● A workshop where someone argues with their tools (literally - the crafting organism is
being temperamental)
● Markets that smell of earth and acid and sweet decay all at once
● Sethrem couples where the Mind-side handles negotiations while the Body-side
examines goods
```
The overall feeling: organized chaos that makes perfect sense to inhabitants but seems
impossibly complex to outsiders. Everything is alive, most things have opinions, and
cooperation isn't an ideal but a practical necessity.

Want to dig deeper into any of these systems? I'm particularly interested in how the
fermentation culture intersects with social class, or how the fungal communication network
creates neighborhoods...

Alright, let's build from the constraints outward - the no-fire taboo is actually a fascinating
pressure point that would reshape _everything_ about daily life.

### Food Without Fire

Start with the basics: **fermentation becomes civilization**. Not just alcohol, but the primary
cooking method. Every household maintains several fermentation vessels - different
organisms for different purposes:


```
● Digest-worms that break down tough fibers into edible paste
● Salt-mothers that cure and preserve meats through enzyme action
● Sweet-rot cultures that transform starches into sugars
```
But here's where it gets interesting - the Flux affects fermentation rates. During Peak,
everything accelerates dangerously. During Falling, cultures go dormant. So communities
have evolved **staggered fermentation cycles** - starting batches at different Flux phases to
ensure continuous food supply. The local expert who can read fermentation timing becomes
as important as any weather-prophet.

### Settlement Layout

Rather than neat planning, settlements grow around **biological infrastructure needs** :

The **Fermentation Quarter** sits downwind (those smells...) but needs morning sun for the
warming. The **Filter Groves** - living root systems that process waste - naturally create
neighborhood boundaries. Rich households cluster near the best groves; poor areas make
do with stressed, less efficient systems.

**Torrnek dormitories** sprawl near the work-yards - simple, rebuilt seasonally, focused on
immediate comfort. **Kemerin warrens** are vertical, complex structures built into and around
larger buildings, connected by rope bridges and climbing paths. **Sethrem households** sit
between, with asymmetric architecture - one entrance at ground level, another accessible
only by climbing.

### The Working Day

A **Torrnek mason** arrives at dawn, following muscle memory through tasks planned
seasons ago by long-forgotten Kemerin architects. They don't need to understand why the
stones go here - the pattern feels right.

A **Kemerin scheduler** clings to their favorite work-perch, orchestrating the day's labor by
manipulating colored stones on a planning board. They signal instructions through drums
and flags, patterns the Torrnek understand without knowing why they work.

**Sethrem intermediaries** walk between both groups, translating when patterns break down,
solving problems that require both immediate action and long-term thinking.

### Domestic Creatures

Not everything is symbiotic - some relationships are just **practical domestication** :

**Burden-snails** the size of wagons, slow but inexorable, following scent trails laid down by
their handlers. They can't be rushed (trying causes them to seal up for days) so communities
plan around their pace.


**Message-moths** that home to specific pheromone signatures. Every household maintains a
**moth-box** with their unique scent-marker. Not symbiosis, just trained behavior - but the
moths need sugar-water every few days or they forget their routes.

**Milk-barnacles** that attach to certain trees and filter sap into protein-rich secretions. Not
really domesticated - more like tolerated parasites that happen to be useful. Children's job to
scrape the milk each morning before school.

### Market Days

The market isn't one place but a **circuit**. Traders move between specialized quarters:

```
● Specimen Row where collectors display their morning finds in damp-boxes
● The Fermentation Exchange where cultures are traded like precious goods
● Syllable Scraps where failed magical experiments get sold as curiosities
● The Pressing Yards where oil-extracting organisms squeeze value from seeds and
nuts
```
Payment varies wildly - formal currency in cities, but rural areas might trade in **fermentation
starts** , **moth-eggs** , or **labor-promises** recorded on knotted cords.

### Resource Cycles

**Protein** comes from:

```
● Insect farms (grub-ranching is a respected profession)
● Milk-barnacles and similar parasites
● River hunters who net fish without hooks (metal is too precious)
● Careful cultivation of protein-rich fungi
```
**Carbohydrates** from:

```
● Starch-heavy root vegetables that grow in low light
● Grain analogues that process through fermentation
● Tree saps concentrated through patient evaporation
```
**Materials** :

```
● Chitin from molted burden-snails and farmed beetles - the primary hard material
● Ceramics made using chemical reactions, not kilns - each potter guards their
catalyst organism jealously
● Pressed wood treated with hardening enzymes
● Metal is rare and precious - only worked through acid etching or pressure forming
```
The interesting tension: communities need to maintain maybe 15-20 different biological
systems just for basic survival. If your digest-worms die, you can't process certain foods. If
your filter groves sick, waste builds up. If your message-moths get confused, communication
breaks down.


This creates natural adventure hooks - "The village's salt-mothers are dying and no one
knows why" becomes a desperate mystery when it means no preserved food for the coming
season.

How does this feel? Too alien or just alien enough?

Excellent instinct - let's build from the ground up, starting with the most basic needs and
seeing what emerges naturally. The key is making it feel inevitable rather than designed.

### Food & Sustenance

**The Fundamental Division**

Torrnek and Kemerin have completely different digestive systems - a biological reality that
shapes everything:

```
● Torrnek process food like we do, but without cooking. They've developed elaborate
fermentation cultures, crushing/grinding techniques, and chemical "cooking" using
specialized organisms. Think Korean fermentation traditions taken to an extreme -
every household maintains multiple fermentation vessels with different bacterial
cultures passed down through families.
```
```
● Kemerin can only digest pre-digested materials. In the wild, they'd be parasitic, but in
society they consume specialized pastes and liquids produced by "processor
beetles" that Torrnek feed. This creates an awkward economic reality: Kemerin
literally cannot survive without Torrnek labor, leading to complex social contracts and
occasional resentment.
```
```
● Sethrem can eat both ways but need both to stay healthy. They often eat socially
with Torrnek while maintaining private Kemerin-food supplies, creating a split dining
culture.
```
**Cultivation Practices**

Without fire, preservation becomes central:

```
● Salt-mining is a major industry (from dried lake beds on desert planets)
● Controlled rot/fermentation specialists are highly valued
● "Fresh chains" - networks of growers timed so something is always in season
● Symbiotic preservation where foods are kept alive but dormant inside specialized
organisms
```
The interesting conflict: Some settlements discovered that certain "pest" species actually
improve food storage, but traditional farmers consider using them blasphemous. You get
underground "pest-keeper" networks.

### Domestic Spaces


**The Three-Height Problem**

Buildings accommodate three scales:

```
● Torrnek-height doorways and furniture
● Kemerin-paths: a secondary network of smaller tunnels/shelves at shoulder height
● Sethrem spaces that need both plus bonding furniture (special chairs that support the
asymmetric weight)
```
This isn't elegant - older buildings were designed for one type and retrofitted badly. You get:

```
● Kemerin-only neighborhoods with tiny elaborate structures Torrnek can't enter
● "Bond-hostile" architecture in conservative areas with deliberately uncomfortable
Sethrem accommodations
● Modern "integrated" buildings that nobody's quite happy with
```
**Living Infrastructure**

The walls are alive - literally. Most buildings are either:

```
● Shaped trees/giant fungi trained over generations
● Coral-like organisms that secrete shell structures
● Woven root systems waterproofed with sap
```
This means:

```
● Buildings need feeding (monthly application of nutrient paste)
● They get sick (architectural parasites are a whole profession to deal with)
● They have moods (some buildings lock residents out when upset)
● They die (a building death is a community crisis - imagine your apartment building
starting to rot)
```
### Daily Rhythms

**The Specimen Morning Market**

Every dawn, collectors bring in the night's harvest. It's chaotic:

```
● Specimens degrading in real-time as sellers hawk them
● Buyers doing rapid field assessments with crude tests
● Kids hired to run specimens to preservation vessels
● Arguments over what was collected where (territory disputes)
● Occasional discoveries that shut down the whole market as everyone gathers to see
```
**The Afternoon Shade**

When the local sun gets intense, everything shifts:

```
● Torrnek continue working (their bark-like skin handles it)
```

```
● Kemerin retreat to shade or interior spaces
● Sethrem get complicated - the Mind side overheats while Body side is fine
● This creates a split-shift economy where different populations work different hours
```
**The Evening Convergence**

The coolest part of day when all three types can work together comfortably:

```
● Major negotiations happen now
● Social dining (though everyone's eating different things)
● Public performances and announcements
● The main market for finished goods
```
### Contradictions & Conflicts

**The Domestication Paradox**

Some creatures are domesticated, others are partners, and the line is blurry:

```
● Draft-slugs are clearly beasts of burden, but they're smart enough to hold grudges
● Message-birds are considered partners by some, property by others
● The "Companion" creature that carries gear is somewhere between pet and
employee
● Some settlements have legislation about creature rights, others think that's absurd
```
**The Preservation Wars**

Three competing philosophies about specimen preservation:

1. **Naturalists** : Let them decay as nature intended, collect fresh daily
2. **Stabilists** : Use every preservation method possible
3. **Cultivists** : Keep specimens alive in mini-gardens until needed

Each group thinks the others are both wasteful and morally wrong. Some families split over
this.

**Water Politics**

Water is weird here:

```
● Some planets have too much (constant rain from their atmosphere-generating plants)
● Others ration carefully
● But you can't just ship water between planets - it often reacts badly to void exposure
● This creates bizarre inequalities where one planet drowns while another thirsts
```
### The Messy Details

**Waste Management**


```
● Everything biological means everything can be composted, but by what?
● Specialized decomposer colonies that sometimes escape and eat buildings
● "Toilet gardens" where waste becomes specimen cultivation
● Social taboos about whose waste can be processed where
```
**Light Sources**

```
● Bioluminescent organisms need feeding schedules
● Some settlements have "light shifts" where people take turns feeding the street lights
● Personal glow-pets that kids carry
● The wealthy have responsive lights that follow them; the poor carry jars
```
**The Clothes Problem**

```
● Fabric is all plant/animal fiber, shaped by organisms rather than woven
● Living clothes that adapt to temperature but need feeding
● Dead clothes that last longer but don't adjust
● Sethrem need special asymmetric cuts that mark their bonded status
```
Does this feel like the right balance of alien-but-comprehensible? I particularly like how the
Torrnek/Kemerin food dependency creates an inescapable economic tension, and how the
three-height architecture problem would be immediately visible to players entering any
settlement.

Alright, let's meander through daily life in Thren. The key is making it feel like a real place
that grew organically rather than was designed, while keeping it playable.

### Food & Sustenance

**The Basic Paradigm** : No cooking with heat means fermentation, chemical processing, and
symbiotic digestion dominate.

Most settlements maintain **Processor Gardens** - patches of specialized organisms that
break down raw materials:

```
● Acid-secreting fungal mats that "cook" root vegetables into digestible mush
● Fermentation beetles that pre-digest grains in their social stomachs
● Tenderizer worms that run through meat, breaking down proteins while adding their
own flavoring secretions
```
But here's the mess: different communities swear by incompatible methods. The northern
settlements insist fermentation beetles ruin the nutritional value, while southerners claim
acid-mat processing causes long-term digestive issues. Both might be right for different
Vostrani body types.

**Common foods** :

```
● Paste-bread - grain mash fermented in living pouches, emerges with a
sourdough-like consistency
```

```
● Thread meat - muscle fibers separated by specialized moths, eaten raw but
"processed"
● Living yogurt - still actively fermenting as you eat it, changes flavor through the
meal
● Crystallized sap - tree blood that hardens into candy-like chunks, primary sweetener
```
The weird part: Torrnek can digest much rougher food than Sethrem. So you get restaurants
with two menus, and awkward situations where bonded pairs can't share meals with their
unbonded relatives without someone suffering.

### Material Culture & Crafts

**Metallurgy without fire** is achieved through:

```
● Acid baths from giant pitcher-plant-like organisms
● Pressure welding using trained constrictor vines
● Bio-corrosion that selectively eats away everything except the desired metal
```
But metal is _expensive_ and _rare_. Most communities make do with:

```
● Grown-wood shaped by careful cultivation
● Chitin harvested from molting megafauna
● Mineral excretions from rock-digesting worms (takes forever, creates natural
concrete)
● Leather that's been chemically treated rather than heat-cured
```
**The Working Beast Problem**

Here's where it gets interesting. Most "beasts of burden" aren't domesticated - they're in
contracts. The **Burden Dancers** (six-legged, low-built grazers) will carry goods in exchange
for specific sprouting seeds they can't gather themselves. But they remember individual
traders who cheat them. Some settlements have three-generation feuds with local Burden
Dancer herds because someone's grandfather shortchanged them on seeds.

Other working relationships:

```
● Canal Worms that dig irrigation in exchange for fermented fruit pulp (addictive to
them)
● Construction Termites that build with secreted paste, but only in patterns they
aesthetically approve of
● Messenger Birds that actually charge different rates based on how interesting they
find the message
```
### Settlement Layout

A typical mixed settlement has distinct quarters that emerged from practical needs:


**The Torrnek Quarter** : Wide streets, heavy construction, everything at ground level. Work
happens outdoors - smithing, farming, building. Communal sleeping halls because they don't
need privacy for thinking.

**The Kemerin Towers** : Vertical structures with climbing surfaces, tiny individual chambers
connected by tubes. Platforms at multiple levels for sun-basking (they need more heat).
Common areas are spherical rooms where many can cling to walls during discussions.

**The Sethrem Bridge** : Mixed architecture that literally bridges between the quarters.
Asymmetric doorways (wider on one side). Furniture with grip surfaces on one armrest.
Public buildings here because Sethrem translate between the other communities.

But here's the dysfunction: The quarters drift apart over time. Young Torrnek and Kemerin
who grow up separated have more trouble bonding. Some progressive settlements force
integration, creating awkward spaces that don't quite work for anyone. Others maintain strict
separation and have higher bonding failure rates.

### The Specimen Economy

This is where things get wonderfully messy. Specimens aren't just resources - they're
_temporal_ resources. That perfect adhesive sap is only produced during the third day after
rainfall. Those explosive seedpods only appear when two specific plants cross-pollinate,
which happens maybe twice a year.

So you get:

```
● Specimen Runners who maintain mental maps of what's available when
● Preservation Guilds that compete over methods (and hoard their techniques)
● Specimen Futures Markets where people trade promises of future harvests
● Black markets in specimens that are technically someone's symbiotic partner
```
The conflict: Wild specimens vs. cultivated. Purists insist wild specimens are more potent.
Practical crafters prefer reliable cultivated sources. Some specimens lose their properties if
cultivated. Others become dangerous if not properly maintained.

### Daily Rhythms

The workday is structured around biological needs:

```
● Dawn feeding - when processor organisms are most active
● Morning work - before the sun-orbit gets too intense
● Noon shelter - many creatures (including adapted Vostrani) avoid midday
● Evening gathering - when many specimens are easiest to collect
● Night processing - fermentation and chemical reactions work best in cool darkness
```
But different planets have different day lengths, and travelers struggle to adapt. There's a
whole industry of "rhythm adjustment" using specific specimens that alter circadian cycles.


### Internal Conflicts

The beautiful mess of it all:

```
● Settlements that domesticated their processor organisms vs. those that maintain wild
populations
● Communities where Torrnek do all physical work vs. integrated labor systems
● Those who trade specimens freely vs. those who guard their local varieties
● Settlements that let their base-creature roam vs. those that anchor it permanently
```
Would you like me to dig into any of these aspects? I'm particularly interested in how the
specimen economy would create adventure hooks - that temporal nature means perfect
timing becomes crucial for certain crafts or solutions.

Alright, let's dig into the messy, lived reality of a Thren settlement. I'll start with the resource
foundations and build up to the social contradictions.

### Food & Resource Cycles

**The Three Pillars of Sustenance**

Most settlements rely on an uneasy balance of three food systems that often conflict:

**Cultivation** - Traditional plots where Torrnek labor maintains:

```
● Root networks that must be negotiated with, not just harvested (they remember who
takes too much)
● Fruiting bodies that only ripen when sung to in specific patterns (different villages
swear by different songs)
● Symbiotic gardens where food plants grow in exchange for processed waste - but the
plants can "go on strike"
```
**Foraging** - The dangerous but necessary practice of:

```
● Following the Flux blooms (abundant during Rising, but that's also when predators
hunt)
● Cliff harvesting for void-touched specimens that grow at gravity edges
● Negotiating with semi-sapient grove collectives who might trade fruit for... strange
favors
```
**Herding** - But not of animals for meat:

```
● Sap-cattle : Large beetle-like creatures milked for nutritious secretions, but they only
produce when anxious (ethical debates rage)
● Memory worms : Whose waste becomes a protein-rich paste, fed stories and songs
which supposedly affect the taste
● Chorus birds : Kept for their eggs, but only lay when part of complex social
hierarchies that constantly need management
```

### The Practical Contradictions

**Water Politics**

```
● The old growth trees can purify any water but charge "root rights" - first claim on
corpses for nutrients
● Modern condensers work during Calm phases only, creating seasonal conflicts
● The Kemerin-designed aqueduct system requires Torrnek maintenance but the
Torrnek don't understand why it needs adjusting every 41 days (prime number
resonance that Kemerin insist is crucial)
```
**Material Culture**

```
● Ceramics are grown in bacterial kilns that take months but produce perfectly, OR
quick-fired using focused Pyr syllables (technically not fire, legally gray area, socially
contentious)
● Two competing systems: the old "singing stone" technique where minerals organize
themselves through sound, vs. imported pressure-forming that's faster but requires
rare specimens
● Metalworking happens through entirely different methods in each district, each
swearing the others are "doing it wrong"
```
### The Market Districts

A typical settlement has three overlapping market systems that barely cooperate:

**Dawn Market** (Torrnek-dominated)

```
● Opens at sunrise, closes when the work bell rings
● Everything is bartered, no abstract currency
● Quality judged by touch, smell, weight
● The same families in the same spots for generations
● "The carrots remember your grandmother"
```
**Pattern Market** (Kemerin-run)

```
● Complex derivative trading of future harvests
● Specimens valued by theoretical properties not yet proven
● Elaborate contracts that account for Flux variations
● Nobody really understands it except the Kemerin
● Crashes spectacularly every few years
```
**Bridge Market** (Sethrem territory)

```
● The only place all three forms mix freely
● Where actual deals get made between the other two markets
● Black market for syllable embodiments and "gray-area" specimens
● Where you go for things that aren't quite legal but aren't quite illegal
```

```
● Run by the Merchant-Bonded, who maintain careful neutrality
```
### Social Tensions in Daily Life

**The Restaurant Problem**

```
● Torrnek establishments serve immediately, forget your order exists once you've eaten
● Kemerin "dining experiences" involve reservations made seasons in advance for
meals that might be theoretical
● Sethrem places try to balance both, satisfy neither
● Street food vendors (mostly broken-bonded) thrive in the gaps
```
**Architecture Wars**

```
● Old buildings grown from directed trees: beautiful, organic, but slowly trying to return
to forest
● Kemerin-designed structures: mathematically perfect, horrible to actually live in
● Torrnek-built homes: sturdy, practical, need constant small repairs the builders don't
remember making
● The ongoing debate about whether buildings should have memories (some do, it's
unsettling)
```
**The Transit System**

```
● Slug-trams that follow pheromone trails, but the slugs have preferences about
passengers
● A vine-swing network maintained by competitive adolescents (both transport and
sport)
● Kemerin-designed probability paths that get you there "eventually"
● Everyone walks, but complains about the others' systems
```
### The Unplanned Nature

Nothing quite works as intended:

```
● The sewage system was designed for a different gravity phase
● Half the buildings face the wrong direction because of a translation error between
Torrnek and Kemerin measurements
● The central plaza floods every third rainfall, but it's tradition now
● The main bridge was supposed to be temporary (200 years ago)
```
Would you like me to dig into any of these deeper? I'm particularly fond of the idea that
different foods literally taste different based on the stories told to the worms that process
them - very Thren, but also something players can immediately engage with ("I tell the
worms a heroic saga to make tomorrow's breakfast taste of courage").

Excellent framing! Let's build out the "mundane miraculous" - the everyday life that feels both
utterly alien and completely logical once you understand it. The key is making systems that


are different enough to be memorable but coherent enough that players can extrapolate from
what they know.

### Food Cycles

**The Three Harvests** Most settlements operate on overlapping food systems:

1. **Growth Gardens** - Traditional agriculture, but with a twist:

```
○ Crops grow in symbiotic clusters where 3-4 species support each other
○ "Whispervines" alert farmers to pest invasions through pheromone releases
○ Harvesting requires negotiation - taking too much causes defensive reactions
○ Some crops only fruit during specific Flux phases
```
2. **Breakdown Colonies** - The fire taboo means no cooking:

```
○ Specialized organisms that pre-digest food at molecular level
○ Community "rendering pools" where tough materials get processed
○ Different colonies for different materials (one for plant matter, one for proteins)
○ Fed with scraps, producing paste that gets flavored with specimens
○ The colonies themselves need tending - they're essentially livestock
```
3. **Contract Herds** - Mobile food sources:

```
○ Not quite domesticated, more like ongoing negotiations
○ Grazers that return to settlements seasonally for protection during vulnerable
phases
○ Provide milk-analogues, shed carapaces, and eventually meat
○ Some settlements follow their herds rather than herds following them
```
**Daily Meals**

```
● Morning: Fresh growth-garden produce with breakdown-paste wrapped in leaves
● Midday: Fermented travel-food (specimen-preserved, doesn't spoil)
● Evening: The main social meal - multiple breakdown products combined with fresh
specimens for flavor
```
### Material Culture

**Without Fire:**

```
● Ceramics → Growing Vessels : Gourd-like plants bred for specific shapes, dried and
cured through chemical processes
● Metal → Boneshell : Harvested from molting creatures, shaped while still pliable
through enzyme treatments
● Glass → Clearweb : Secretions from domesticated insects, stretched and layered
while wet
● Textiles → Multiple sources:
○ Silk-worms (traditional but adapted)
```

```
○ Bark-cloth beaten from specific trees
○ Symbiotic clothing that's actually alive (needs feeding but self-repairs)
```
### Settlement Layout

**The Living Infrastructure:**

A typical settlement has zones based on biological needs:

**The Heart** - Central breakdown pools and specimen storage

```
● Always downwind (the smell...)
● Heavily guarded (contamination = starvation)
● Professional tenders who are respected but socially isolated
```
**Growth Rings** - Concentric agricultural zones

```
● Inner ring: Daily vegetables, quick-growing
● Middle ring: Staple crops, monthly harvest
● Outer ring: Orchards and grazing contracts
```
**The Canopy** - Vertical element

```
● Bridge-vine cultivators maintaining interplanetary connections
● Syllable scholars in towers (height = less interference)
● Navigation roosts for the various travel-creatures
```
**Workshops** - Scattered based on needs:

```
● Boneshell shapers near water (enzyme baths)
● Weavers near insect colonies
● Specimen processors at settlement edges
```
### Working Creatures

Instead of horses/oxen, settlements maintain relationships with:

**Haulers** - Six-legged, low to ground, incredibly strong

```
● Sleep 20 hours a day, work intensely for 4
● Different settlements coordinate their waking cycles
● Fed through special breakdown pools (too big for normal feeding)
```
**Messengers** - Borrowed from the bridge-vines

```
● Small pods that remember locations
● Launched between settlements on preset routes
● Take 2-3 days to "program" a new route
```

**Builders** - Essentially trained coral

```
● Secrete structures over frames
● Take months to build anything
● Fed minerals and specimens to control color/strength
```
### Social Rhythms

**The Daily Pulse:**

```
● Dawn: Specimen collection (best time for most species)
● Morning: Physical labor (Torrnek-dominated time)
● Midday: Rest and breakdown-pool tending
● Afternoon: Planning and design (Kemerin/Sethrem time)
● Evening: Social meal and community decisions
● Night: Syllable work (less interference)
```
**Market Days:** Not buying/selling but rather:

```
● Specimen exchanges (trading collections)
● Skill-sharing (teaching symbiotic techniques)
● Breakdown pool access (communities share specialized colonies)
● Route information (navigators trade recent conditions)
```
**The Key:** Everything operates on biological rhythms rather than mechanical schedules. A
shop isn't "closed" - the symbiotic door-creature is sleeping. The breakdown pools determine
meal times. The haulers' wake cycle sets market days.

Does this feel like it hits the right balance? Alien enough to be interesting but with clear
enough logic that players can think "what would I need in this world?" and extrapolate?

Right, let's dig into this! The trick is making daily life feel both utterly alien and completely
reasonable once you understand the logic. Like how a documentary about leafcutter ants
makes their fungus farming seem both bizarre and inevitable.

### Settlement Structure: The Living Quarters Problem

Here's a key constraint that shapes everything: **Kemerin need different architecture than
Torrnek**.

Kemerin are cat-sized climbers with six limbs - they'd naturally build in three dimensions,
with pathways along walls and ceilings, small tunnel-networks between rooms, perching
spots rather than chairs. Torrnek need human-scale doors, floors they can work on, storage
at standing height.

So a mixed settlement might have:


```
● The Lattice - Kemerin quarter with its interconnected climbing structures, like a
massive jungle gym made from cultivated wood
● The Ground - Torrnek quarter with workshops, heavy storage, communal kitchens
● The Bridge - Sethrem architecture that serves both, with split-level designs,
asymmetric doorways, furniture that accommodates the bonded form
```
This immediately creates natural meeting points and segregation. The market might be in
The Bridge because everyone can access it. But the best Mind-food grows in The Lattice's
vertical farms, while grain processing happens in The Ground.

### Daily Routine: The Specimen Morning

Every morning starts with **specimen tending** - not gathering, but maintaining what you
already have. Like checking on sourdough starter, but it's:

```
● Feeding your door-seal membrane its sugar water
● Checking if your light-polyps need their shells cleaned
● Harvesting today's adhesive from your glue-grubs before they pupate
```
This creates a natural rhythm. Everyone's doing their rounds at dawn. It's social - you might
trade a bit of excess lamp-nectar for your neighbor's spare filter-moss. The
specimen-tender's call (maybe a specific whistle pattern that doesn't wake the day-shift
Torrnek) marks the real start of the day.

### Commerce Without Fire

The market becomes fascinating when you can't have cooked food stalls. Instead:

```
● Fermentation stands - selling various stages of fermented foods, from fresh-pickled
to years-aged
● Enzymatic preparers - who maintain colonies of breakdown organisms that can
"cook" food chemically
● Chill vendors - using specimens that endothermically react to create frozen treats
● Pressure processors - using specialized organisms that can compress/transform
ingredients
```
The sounds would be totally different - no sizzling, but lots of bubbling, hissing of pressure
releases, the crunch of mechanical grinding, the wet sounds of enzymatic breakdown.

### Professional Guilds as Symbiotic Networks

The **Cultivator's Circle** isn't just a guild - they literally share starter cultures. Breaking guild
rules means your specimens might be contaminated or rejected by the guild's maintained
organisms. Your professional standing has biological enforcement.

The **Navigator's Symbiosis** maintains navigation creatures collectively. Each navigator
might carry one breeding pair, but they only thrive when multiple navigators meet and


exchange genetic material between their specimens. This forces regular gatherings and
makes isolated navigators gradually lose their edge.

### The Living Infrastructure

Every building is partially alive, which means:

```
● Maintenance crews are more like veterinarians than construction workers
● Building sickness can spread between structures that share root systems
● Seasonal dormancy means some buildings literally close for winter
● Growth management - pruning crews prevent buildings from overgrowing their plots
```
The sounds of a settlement would include the creaking of growth, the breathing of ventilation
bladders, the chittering of maintenance beetles, the gurgling of water being processed
through filter systems.

### Social Spaces

**The Evening Pools** - communal bathing but also where you feed your hygiene symbionts.
The pools have different sections:

```
● Enzyme pools for Torrnek to break down the day's grime
● Mist chambers where Kemerin can clean while climbing
● Junction pools designed for Sethrem's asymmetric forms
```
**Memory Halls** - since Torrnek have short memory, communities maintain physical spaces
where important information is encoded in textures, scents, and repeated physical patterns.
Torrnek can walk through and literally feel their history, while Kemerin narrate the context.

### What This Means for Play

When players enter a settlement, the GM can quickly establish:

```
● Time of day by which maintenance chorus is active
● Social tensions by which quarters are busiest
● Economic health by the variety of fermentation smells
● Political climate by which guild markers are displayed prominently
```
Players would naturally ask different questions:

```
● "Where do I stable my transport-beast?" becomes "Where's the symbiont corral?"
● "I look for a tavern" becomes "I follow the fermentation smells to the social pools"
● "I need supplies" becomes "I need to refresh my specimens"
```
Does this balance feel right? Alien enough to be fascinating but grounded enough that
players can reason about it?


Alright, let's meander around daily life in a way that feels both alien and intuitive. I think the
key is to start with recognizable social functions but transform them through your world's
specific constraints.

### The Daily Rhythm

**Dawn Chorus** - Not birds, but the settlement's symbiotic infrastructure waking up:

```
● Breathing vents in buildings shift from night to day cycle (audible wheeze/sigh)
● Bioluminescent organisms dim as photosynthetic ones activate
● The morning "stretch" as architectural symbionts adjust to temperature
● Everyone knows the sound means it's time to wake up - universal across cultures
```
**The Three Streams** - settlements naturally organize around three parallel daily rhythms:

```
● Torrnek districts : Wake with true dawn, immediate physical activity, communal
breakfast
● Kemerin quarters : Often semi-nocturnal, peak activity during transition hours
● Sethrem spaces : Bridge the schedule, active throughout but with midday rest
```
### The Market as Living System

Instead of stalls, imagine **cultivation pods** - living structures that:

```
● Display specimens in their optimal conditions (so they stay fresh)
● Literally grow around their contents
● Vendors "tend" their pod throughout the day
● Pods remember regular customers through scent/chemical recognition
● Payment might involve feeding the pod with specific nutrients
```
**The Specimen Exchange** works like a combination farmers market/pet store/pharmacy:

```
● Morning deliveries still wriggling/growing
● "Fresh" means literally still alive
● Haggling includes demonstrating the specimen's response to stimuli
● Some vendors maintain parent organisms on-site for immediate cultivation
● The social hub where collectors share route information
```
### Architecture That Breathes

Buildings are **grown, not built** , but this manifests practically:

```
● Growth Rings - older buildings have visible layers showing their age
● Seasonal Rooms - some spaces only accessible during certain Flux phases
● The Feeding Schedule - buildings need nutrients poured into root systems
● Sick Building Syndrome - when a structure's symbiont becomes ill, everyone
knows the symptoms
```

```
● Building Singers - specialists who diagnose architectural health through vibration
patterns
```
The **neighborhood watch** is literally watching for:

```
● Signs of building illness
● Dormancy approaching
● Pest infestations
● Structural symbiont rejection
```
### Social Spaces

**The Confluence** - every settlement's central space where all three populations naturally mix:

```
● Shaped like a bowl or spiral to accommodate different scales
● Kemerin perches at multiple heights
● Torrnek gathering spaces at ground level
● Sethrem mediation platforms between
● Often built around the settlement's oldest/largest architectural organism
```
**Grooming Parlors** - but for symbionts:

```
● Where you take your tools/equipment for maintenance
● Social gossip hub
● Different sections for different organism types
● The symbiont-groomer relationship often hereditary
● Where young people meet potential bond-partners (both romantic and practical)
```
### The Working Day

**Shift Patterns** accommodate the three states:

```
● Memory Work (dawn): Torrnek-only shifts for repetitive tasks
● Planning Sessions (mid-morning): Kemerin-heavy coordination
● Integration Hours (midday): Sethrem-essential complex work
● Maintenance Time (evening): Mixed groups tending to infrastructure
```
**The Calling** - instead of job boards:

```
● Pheromone posts that smell different based on what work is needed
● Kemerin can detect complexity level
● Torrnek sense physical difficulty
● Sethrem perceive both plus duration
● Updates throughout the day as positions fill
```
### Small Necessary Details


**Timekeeping** without mechanical clocks:

```
● Scheduled flowering of time-plants
● Bioluminescent tide marks that glow in sequence
● The Pulse - a settlement-wide biological rhythm everyone feels
```
**Waste Management** that makes sense:

```
● Everything organic feeds something else
● Specialized decomposer organisms for different waste types
● The settlement's "stomach" - a central digestion pit
● Taboo against non-biological waste (reinforces the fire taboo)
```
**Children's Spaces** :

```
● Nursery Groves where Mind and Body children play separately but in sight
● Bonding Preparation Schools for adolescents
● The Watching Trees - elderly caregivers of both species
```
This gives GMs recognizable structures (markets, neighborhoods, workplaces) but with
enough unique flavor that it feels distinctly Thren. Players can think "I need to buy
something" and intuitively head to the Specimen Exchange, but what they find there is
wonderfully alien.

Want to drill deeper into any of these? I'm particularly interested in how the Flux affects
these daily rhythms - maybe certain shops only open during Rising, or buildings get sluggish
during Falling?

Excellent constraint to work with! Let's build daily life that feels both alien and immediately
graspable. The key is making everything follow clear internal logic even when it's utterly
unlike Earth.

### The Settlement as Living System

**The Morning Routine**

Settlements wake with their architecture. The building-symbionts respond to the first light
hitting their photosynthetic surfaces, opening ventilation pores and releasing the night's
accumulated moisture as a gentle morning mist. The Torrnek are already up - they've been
moving since the grey pre-dawn, their bodies needing less sleep but forgetting why they
started any particular task if interrupted.

The Kemerin clusters begin their descent from their night roosts - hollows in the
building-symbiont's upper reaches where they huddle for warmth and protection. They
chirp-click in their morning language, reviewing the day's plans they memorized before
sleep. Some ride down on the shoulders of early-rising Sethrem, others navigate the descent
paths built into the living walls.

**The Market Pools**


Markets aren't squares but "pools" - depressions where multiple building-symbionts' root
systems intermingle. Here's where the specimen economy actually _works_ :

```
● The Fresh Rings : Outermost circle where today's gatherers display specimens in
living containers - modified gourd-plants that preserve specific humidity/temperature
● The Cultivation Rows : Middle ring where symbiont-breeders maintain their breeding
stock in elaborate terrarium-like growths
● The Exchange Pool : Center depression where the barter actually happens, often
literally a shallow pool of treated water that keeps trading specimens viable during
negotiation
```
Torrnek handle the physical exchange, Kemerin track the complex multi-party trades,
Sethrem negotiate the subtle social dynamics. You know exactly where to go for what you
need, but the specific specimens available shift with the Flux - during Peak, the pools
overflow with exotic specimens; during Falling, they contract to essentials.

**Professional Districts**

Settlements naturally segregate by biological needs:

**The Damp Quarter** - Where anything involving Mhir (water) happens:

```
● Laundries using enzymatic cleaners
● Brewers fermenting with controlled organisms
● Bathhouses that are actually symbiotic cleansing pools
● Always located downslope, creating natural drainage
```
**The Heights** - Where syllable work happens:

```
● Built on raised platforms or natural elevations
● Kemerin-majority population (they like the climbing)
● Embodiment shops with specimens in specialized containers
● Libraries of reference organisms (living books that grow their text)
● The air smells of ozone from syllabic discharge
```
**The Workways** - Torrnek-dominated crafting area:

```
● Organized by rhythm - hammering/grinding/weaving all synchronized
● Each craft has its own beating pattern others unconsciously follow
● Sethrem supervisors stationed at rhythm-break points where workflows shift
```
### Social Infrastructure

**Identity Markers**

Without fire for forging metal badges or burning brands, identity works through:

```
● Scent-marks : Personal symbiotic bacteria colonies that produce unique identifiers
● Shell-tokens : Carved pieces of your birth building-symbiont, impossible to fake
```

```
● Pattern-scarring : The natural skin patterns enhanced through controlled symbiont
exposure
```
**Time-Keeping**

No mechanical clocks, but:

```
● Flux Bells : Organisms that chime at Flux transitions
● Shift Beetles : Insects that emerge in reliable waves throughout the day
● Community Rhythms : The Workways' beating patterns everyone unconsciously
tracks
```
**The Evening Return**

As light fades, the settlement contracts. Building-symbionts begin closing their outer
passages, drawing residents toward protected cores. The evening meal happens in stages:

1. Torrnek prepare the physical components - crushing, mixing, arranging
2. Kemerin add the enzymatic preparations that break down proteins
3. Sethrem manage the precise timing of consumption before compounds degrade

Night brings different hazards - some predator specimens become active, syllabic
emanations grow unstable, and the building-symbionts' immune responses sometimes
mistake residents for threats if they move wrong.

### What Makes This Playable

Players can think "I need to buy supplies" and know:

```
● Go to the Market Pools
● Check the Fresh Rings first for today's specimens
● Bring something to trade (currency is literally living barter)
● Respect the pool protocols (keep specimens wet)
```
They can think "I need information" and know:

```
● The Heights for anything scholarly
● Workways for practical craft knowledge
● Damp Quarter for social gossip (bathhouses are universal)
```
The alien elements (no fire, living buildings, three-species society) create flavor without
blocking intuitive navigation of social space.

Would you like to dig into any of these systems more specifically? I'm particularly interested
in how the specimen economy actually flows day-to-day, or how different settlements might
vary based on their primary building-symbionts.
