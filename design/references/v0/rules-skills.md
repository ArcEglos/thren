# Physically act


## Physically act

Fight, lift, sneak, climb, break, quick reflexes, push through

**Physical refine:**

**- You help an ally with their action
- Roll 2d6
- Any successes get added**

**Physical initiate:**

**- Add 2 to your dicepool for observation related to physical activity
- You have access to the physical skill
- Your body strain limit is increased by 2
- Your hit overwhelm limit is increased by 2**

##### Approach

When doing something physical, first decide your approach. Some might be easier than
others. Your equipment and abilities influence which of them suit you.

1. **Force** : Direct, overwhelming, exhausting
2. **Finesse** : Precise, efficient, quiet
3. **Endurance** : Persistent, grinding, inevitable

##### Resolution

For immediate actions and combat, roll a Dicepool(3 - Strain). For extended tasks use a
Track with multiple steps, potentially with contribution from multiple characters. One die has
a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

You may choose to take physical strain to:

```
● Force an approach without proper tools on a task that is possible (2 strain)
● Add one to a die after you rolled (2 strain)
● Add a die to your pool (1 strain)
```
Any extra dice that are success after the first:

```
● Reduce time required
● Accomplish with style/stealth
● Create advantages for allies
● During combat:
○ Bolster the Attack for +1 additional Hit
○ Repel a foe away from you
○ Stop a foe from moving with their next action or until your next action
```

```
○ Impair a weapon on its next action or until your next action
○ Knock a foe down
● Or similar
```
##### Equipment

Tools and equipment have a big influence on the approaches you can use for physical tasks
and how easy or hard they are. Approaches or entire tasks can be entirely impossible
without the right equipment.

```
● Climbing gear : Enables Finesse approach on climbs
● Sledgehammer : Enables Force approach vs stone/metal
● Breathing symbiote : Enables Endurance in hostile atmosphere
● Lock picks : Required for Finesse approach on locks
```
The same also applies for weapons

```
● Light weapons (knives, clubs): 1 Hit per success, finesse approach available, can
be concealed
● Heavy weapons (hammers, axes): 2 Hits per success, force approach only, can’t be
concealed
● Range weapons (bows): Allow Hits from range, useless up close
```
```
and armor:
```
```
● Light (leather, cloth): Guard +1
● Medium (chitin, wood): Guard + 2, finesse approach at -1 die
● Heavy (metal, stone): Guard + 3, force approach only, endurance tasks +1 strain
```

# Weave


## Weave

Magic operates through the manipulation of fundamental sound-patterns called
syllables—vibrational constructs that can reshape reality when properly arranged.

##### Casting Spells

A spell is a poem that defines what the spell does - subject to interpretation. You cast Spells
at will, but each Spell is single use.
If you stretch the meaning of the poem, the GM might ask for rolling a Dicepool to see if you
can control the energy - the spell goes off either way, but the check decides how close to the
desired effect. You can take a Body Strain or Mind Strain to add a die to the pool for each
Strain taken.

The distance of Spells is by default "within view" - but depending on the poem things might
work better or worse over different distances.
On a rest, lose all spells you currently hold.

To keep a spell after casting it or over a rest, take a body strain.

##### Creating spells

You can create Spells during a Rest. The complexity and power of your spells is limited by
your Affinity.

Affinity = 3 + Flux modifier - Strain (higher of Body&Mind)

The Ritual:

```
● Take any number of Syllable Embodiments
● Throw them
● Group them by the line they point towards on the throw area
● Each group becomes a spell
● You can cut a group into two spells by taking 1 Mind Strain for each cut you want to
make
● If you have innate syllables, add each of them to an existing spell
```
You can take 1 Mind Strain to do a rapid creation ritual taking just a few seconds. Your
affinity for spells created by this ritual is zero.

##### Flux interaction

Magic is massively influenced by the flux pattern on a planet!

```
● Calm : No effect
● Rising : Affinity + 1
● Peak :
```

```
○ Affinity +2
○ Using consumable syllable embodiments doesn’t degrade them
○ Spell interpretation is more malleable
● Falling :
○ Affinity becomes 0
○ Using consumable syllable embodiments fully consumes them
```
##### Leaking spells

A spell leaks some or all of its syllables if it is more complex than your affinity when you
create it.

Effects of leaking spells can range from mild (a single Mhir leaking might mean that if you
touch paper it leaves it wet) to disastrous (five Durn leaking could mean you're becoming as
heavy as a rock your size and are mostly petrified)

##### Innate Syllables

A syllable that is deeply embedded into a character that they are able to add to spells at will
in a controlled fashion.

Acquiring such an innate syllable usually takes a sizable toll on the body due to the intimate
entangling of the host and the arcane. The exact shape is often (but not always) related to
the syllable in question. Someone with innate Mhir might develop gills or constantly damp
skin, while innate Keth could cause a person to exist partially in multiple states
simultaneously.

##### Syllabic Vocabulary

The known syllables each embody fundamental concepts:

```
● Zhex - Fast directed movement, momentum, pursuit
● Ilt - Compression, narrowness, passage through constraints
● Sahn - Stationarity, stillness, patience, quiet
● Wyrv - Bending, rotation, circular motion, return
● Bhol - Expansion, swelling, growth, generosity
● Pyr - Warmth, glow, light, comfort (never fire)
● Vod - Absence, void, negation, without
● Yoth - Growth, exuberance, wild flourishing, indulgence
● Qem - Order, thought, pattern recognition, mind
● Mhir - Water, flow, adaptation, cleansing
● Durn - Substance, earth, weight, permanence
● Keth - Edge, threshold, boundary, between
```

##### Syllable Embodiments

The embodiment of Syllables - the physical items used when creating spells - can be more
vague or precise, better or worse. The simplest ones are reasonably common trinkets, exotic
ones can be reasons for an adventure in itself.

Better embodiments give additional constraints on the poem to get either more powerful or
more predictable results (or, rarely, both).

Embodiments can be stable or degrade or break with usage.


# Socialize


## Socialize

##### The Network Web

The table is part of a network of social connections - each with their own character and
depth.

This social network exists as a physical play aid:

```
● Index cards for NPCs arranged on table
● Colored lines drawn between cards showing relationships:
○ Green = Clean (honest foundations)
○ Yellow = Pressured (leverage/obligation)
○ Red = Dirty (built on deception)
● Points/tokens on lines representing available capital
● Snippets noted on cards ("values tradition," "fears scandal," "lost daughter to
plague")
```
##### Social Encounters

The attitude of NPCs you encounter in a scene will be based on the connections you have
with them.

"The Harbor Master greets you warmly—the Guild's letter clearly carries weight, and the
dockworkers mentioned your name. 'Inspector,' she says, studying your forged credentials, 'I
wasn't expecting an inspection today...'"

The conversation flows naturally without mechanical interruption. The social capital has
already shaped the scene. NPCs still have their own interests and constraints to navigate,
don’t expect a close connection to just mean you get what you want.

Take 1 Strain to have a backup show up during the conversation if things are going south.

Resolution (If Needed)

Only when the outcome remains uncertain you roll a Dicepool(Connection - Strain). One die
has a different color - this is the momentum die (1-3 shifts momentum)

The Approach of your connections affects how success manifests.

Dirty Connection Exposure

When using dirty connections, roll a single d6 at the beginning of the scene for each:

```
● 1-2 : Exposed immediately—scene turns hostile
● 3-4 : Suspicion raised—future complication
● 5-6 : Deception holds... for now
```

Take 1 Mind Strain to hold together an exposed connection until after the scene has
concluded.

##### Building Capital

When you interact with others, your social network changes and evolves.
Complete favors, find a pen pal, save or protect someone to gain points. Apply pressure or
blackmail to use your leverage to force points, or construct elaborate lies to swindle points.

The type of connection depends on how you built it, not what you want it to be:

**Honest** : Building genuine trust through mutual benefit (clean)

```
● Slow to build, slow to decay
● NPCs may exceed expectations when helping
```
**Leverage** : Using power, resources, or obligation (pressured)

```
● Quick to establish but requires maintenance
● NPCs comply but remember being pressured
```
**Deceptive** : Lies, false identities, misdirection (dirty)

```
● Powerful but inherently unstable
● Risk of catastrophic exposure
```
You can play these out as social encounters or summarize them as narrated processes,
depending on the situation and the preferences of the table. Also sending letters and other
actions can be useful for this. Not everything needs to be a conversation.

##### Moving Capital Through the Network

When you ask for an introduction, you're spending your points asking intermediaries to
spend THEIR capital on your behalf, probably taking a “cut”. Long chains can get quite
inefficient - or risky.

NPCs can refuse if they can't afford the social cost:

```
● "I don't have enough pull with them anymore"
● "I'm saving my favor with them for something important"
● "After what happened last time? My reputation with them is already strained"
```
Take 1 Mind Strain to push an intermediary beyond their comfort zone in making a
connection.

##### Snippets

Information about NPCs that modifies social interactions:

```
● Applying the correct snippet doubles dice from that connection
```

● Wrong application might backfire spectacularly
● Unknown snippets can be discovered through Study or Social observation


# Symbiosis


## Symbiosis

Technology in Thren emerges from biological cooperation rather than mechanical
construction. Characters collect living specimens and combine their essential properties to
solve problems. Every creation involves working with living systems, maintaining the "no fire"
taboo while reinforcing the symbiotic theme.

##### Specimen

Discovery & Collection

**At the end of each Rest** : You declare 2 Tags or specific Specimen you’re watching for.

Take 1 Body Strain to swap the tags you look for while on the road

**When starting a Rest** : Roll Dicepool(3 - Strain), modified by:

```
● Environments encountered during the day
● Whether party rushed or took time
```
Distribute successes on declared tags to prioritize.

**Specimen Generation**

Specimens consist of:

```
● Name : Evocative identifier
● Tags : 2-4 mechanical properties [adhesive] [weightless] [void-touched]
● Description : One sentence of flavor
● Abundance : Plentiful / Sufficient / Scarce / Trace
● Shape : Tetris-style grid shape for storage
```
Research using the Knowledge Skill can reveal additional hidden tags of a Specimen.

Example:

Voidwhisper Sap
[adhesive] [weightless] [Peak-sensitive]
"Amber secretion that seems to fall upward, humming faintly"
Abundance: Sufficient
Shape: 1x3 liquid strip

Abundance & Consumption

```
● Plentiful : Use freely, many applications
● Sufficient : 2-3 uses
● Scarce : 1-2 uses
```

```
● Trace : Single use only
```
Abundance degrades with use, depending on the projects you use the Specimen for.

Storage

Specimens need to be stored with the Group Companion.

**At each rest** , roll 1d6 per specimen. On a 1 it decays and is lost.

Take 1 Body Strain to prevent a Specimen from decaying.

##### Combination

1. **Declare Intent** : State what you're trying to create/solve
2. **Select Specimens & Tags** : Choose which specimens and specific tags to use
3. **Explain Connections** : Narrate how tags work together
    ○ Each connection links two tags logically
    ○ Creative interpretation encouraged
4. **Roll Connection Test** : 1d6 per connection + 1d6 for each Body Strain
    ○ 1: Backfire
    ○ 2-3: Failure
    ○ 4-6: Success
    ○ Failures on Strain dice shorten longevity/durability of result

Take 1 Body Strain to reroll a connection

Resolution

**Field Crafting (Immediate):**

Interpret behavior of result based on which connections succeeded.
The first d6 is also the momentum die.

**Project Crafting (Long-term)**

```
● Successes advance track that many segments
● Failures add new requirements
● Backfires may branch track or demand different approach
```
Project crafting happens during a Rest, you can only do one session per rest.

Take a Strain appropriate for the project to force an additional project session during a rest.

##### Flux Interaction

```
● Calm : No effect
● Rising : More Specimens (+1 tag)
● Peak :
○ Plentiful Specimens (+1 tag & +1 die to dicepool)
```

○ Connections succeed on a 3+
○ Decayed specimens mutate into something interesting
● **Falling** :
○ All specimen maintenance rolls at -2
○ Project tracks lose 1 segment each rest you don’t work on them
○ Connections succeed only on 5-6


# Study


## Study

##### Mental Loadout

You maintain a **Mental Loadout** of reference materials you currently made yourself familiar
with. You can only use reference materials from this loadout.

**Loadout slots** : (4 - Strain)

**During Rest** : Free reorganization of entire loadout

You can take 1 Mind Strain to swap out one item in your loadout at any time.

##### Reference Materials

Reference materials enable research and determine quality of results.

References are physical items that:

```
● Take up inventory space
● Can be lost, damaged, or stolen
● Vary in quality and scope
● May require specific conditions to use (light, quiet, language)
```
##### Exhaustion

Studying unknown fields can be exhausting. You’ll need to take a break after a while.

**Track size by Study skill** :

```
● Study 2: 3 boxes
● Study 3: 5 boxes
● Study 4: 7 boxes
```
When exhaustion track overflows, take a Mind Strain for each overflow

You clear 3 Exhaustion during each Rest.

##### Research Process

1. Pick research depth

**Quick Scan** (seconds/minutes):

```
● No exhaustion cost
● Surface information only
● Requires Good Match or better
```

**Standard Research** (hours):

```
● 2 exhaustion
● Complete answers within scope
● Can attempt with any match level
```
**Deep Dive** (half day):

```
● 3 exhaustion
● Reveals hidden connections
● Treats source as one level better
```
**Cross-Reference** (full day):

```
● 5 exhaustion
● Combine multiple sources
● Use best source's match level and treat it as one better than that
● Can reveal contradictions
```
Take 1 Mind Strain to speed up research by one category.

2. Consult reference material

If you have more than one Mind Strain, treat sources as one level worse.

**Perfect Match** (source directly covers question):

```
● Automatic success, no roll needed
● Example: Using creature manual for that exact creature
```
**Good Match** (source covers general topic):

```
● Automatic success for basic info
● Roll d6 (4+) for deeper insights
● Example: Using biology text for new specimen
```
**Stretch** (source is related/adjacent):

```
● Roll d6, need 4+ for success
● Failure = plausible but wrong
● Example: Using plant guide for fungi
```
**Wild Stretch** (barely connected):

```
● Roll d6, need 6 for success
● Failure = dangerous misinformation
● Example: Using poetry for navigation
```
**No Source** (pure deduction):

```
● Not possible
```

If you roll a d6, it is also a momentum die.
