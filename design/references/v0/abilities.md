## Abilities

#### Physically Act Abilities

**Adrenaline Surge** - Once per dangerous scene, clear 2 hits before they convert to strain
when crashing. The body remembers how to push through.

**Momentum Thief** - When you succeed on a Physical roll and momentum would shift, you
can take 2 Body strain instead of 1 to steal an additional die for your next Physical action this
scene.

**Tool Whisperer** - You can use tools in unintended ways. Once per scene, declare an
impossible approach for your equipment (like using a hammer for Finesse). Roll normally.

**Scarred Resilience** - Your overwhelmed threshold increases by 1 for each scar you have.
Pain has become a teacher.

**Kinetic Memory** - When attempting a physical task you've failed before in this adventure,
add an extra die. The body learns through repetition.

**Void Veteran** - Ignore the first Body strain from environmental hazards each scene (vacuum,
toxic air, extreme gravity). Your body has adapted to hostile spaces.

#### Symbiosis Abilities

**Specimen Whisperer** - Once per rest, coax a "failed" specimen collection roll to produce
something unexpected but useful (different tags than declared).

**Rapid Cultivation** - During field crafting, treat your first failed connection roll as a success,
but the creation only lasts until the end of the scene.

**Symbiotic Storage** - Your body has adapted internal pouches. Store one small specimen
(1x1 or 1x2) internally. It never degrades but using it causes 1 Body strain.

**Flux Farmer** - During Peak Flux, you can preserve specimens indefinitely without rolling.
During Falling, you can still collect (at -2 dice).

**Living Toolkit** - Permanently bonded with a tool-creature. Define its specialty
(cutting/adhering/detecting). It doesn't take inventory space but needs feeding (1 specimen
per rest).

**Emergency Synthesis** - Take 2 Body strain to immediately combine two specimens without
rolling. The result is unstable and causes a complication the GM chooses.


#### Socialize Abilities

**Provocateur** - When a social encounter goes badly, gain 2 points in a Dirty connection with
someone present as they reveal more than intended.

**Network Architect** - You can maintain one connection at -1 (owing them) indefinitely without
it being called in, representing your value to them.

**Snippet Hoarder** - You start each session with 1d3 random snippets about NPCs you
haven't met yet. GM provides when you meet them.

**Diplomatic Immunity** - Once per session, invoke a connection you don't have yet. You owe
them 3 points (starting at -3).

**Emotional Equilibrium** - When taking Mind strain from social situations, roll 1d6. On 5-6,
inspire someone present to help without spending connection points.

#### Study Abilities

**Parallel Processing** - Your Mind-side can maintain two Mental Loadouts simultaneously, but
switching between them mid-scene causes 1 Mind strain.

**Living Library** - One of your reference sources is a symbiotic organism. It can answer one
question perfectly per session but requires feeding (specific specimen).

**Pattern Recognition** - When observing, use your Study skill instead of your best applicable
skill. You see data where others see chaos.

**Exhaustion Vampire** - When collaborating on research, you can shift your exhaustion boxes
to willing partners (representing mental load sharing).

**Speed Reader** - You can do a Quick Scan on any text-based clue instantly, even in
dangerous situations. This includes syllabic inscriptions and biological patterns.

#### Weave Abilities

**Syllable Sanctuary** - You have an innate syllable embedded in your being. Choose one.
Add it to every spell but gain a permanent physical mark.

**Flux Rider** - During Peak, your spells can affect one additional target. During Falling, you
can cast normally by taking 1 Mind strain per spell.

**Poem Stretcher** - Once per rest, wildly reinterpret a spell's poem without rolling. It works,
but syllables leak causing minor chaos for a full scene.

**Metamagic Memory** - You can hold one spell indefinitely between rests without strain. It
becomes part of your identity.


**Syllabic Immune System** - When a spell would affect you, spend 1 Mind strain to steal one
syllable from it, disrupting the effect and gaining the syllable temporarily.

**Emergency Weaver** - You can create spells without syllable embodiments by taking 1 Body
strain per syllable, pulling patterns from your own life force.

#### Generic Abilities

**Bonded Dysfunction** - Your Mind and Body sides can act independently in emergencies.
Split your dice pool but take two actions. Both must succeed or both fail.

**I Know A Guy** - Start with 3 points in a connection you can define when you first use it.
They're weird, though.

**Void Touched** - You've been exposed to raw Aether. You can sense disruptions in space
(hidden passages, approaching void-swimmers, reality tears).

**Cultural Chameleon** - You can fake being from any culture you've spent a rest observing.
Lasts until you fail a check or someone from that culture tests you.

**Desperation Protocol** - When both strain tracks are at limit-1, you can succeed at any
single roll automatically but immediately shut down one side after.

**Scar Reader** - You can read someone's scars (physical and mental) like a history book.
Learn one truth about their past trauma per scar visible.

**Flux Battery** - You can store the current Flux phase within yourself. Release it later to create
a bubble of that phase for one scene.

**Companion Empath** - Your connection to the group's companion creature is profound. It
gains +2 strain limit and you always know its emotional state.
