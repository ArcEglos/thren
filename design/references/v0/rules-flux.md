# Flux


## Flux

All planets have a flux cycle - impacting biology and magic alike. The cycles are different and
yet connected. Working against the Flux is just as deadly as working with it empowering.

Besides environmental changes that influence everything from travelling to social structure,
the flux also influences the Weave and Symbiosis skills directly.

##### The Four Phases

**Calm**

```
● The universe rests
● Systems operate predictably but with reduced energy
● The safest time, but also the least dynamic
```
**Rising**

```
● The universe stirring to wakefulness
● Risk and reward both increase
● Hidden possibilities begin to emerge
```
**Peak**

```
● Extreme effects dominate
● Impossible becomes possible
● Normal becomes dangerous
```
**Falling**

```
● Systems break down unpredictably
● Chaos creates unexpected openings
● Desperation drives innovation
● The universe exhausting itself
```
##### Tracking

Each world maintains its own Flux track, moving along the track every day.

```
● Typically 4-20 segments long
● Peak and Falling are usually a single segment
● Calm is often the longest phase
```
When cosmic events shake reality, the flux cycle can stall or slip. This is always telegraphed.
