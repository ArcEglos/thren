## Title

Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds: A Crude Rendering of Thren

### Core Concept and Tone

This setting presents a cosmos observed through the lens of natural history and
anthropological study, where the fantastical elements emerge from careful observation rather
than arbitrary construction. The universe consists of countless small planets—ranging from a
few meters to several kilometers in diameter—connected by gravity-defying plant life and
inhabited by beings of vastly different scales. The world operates on principles of symbiosis,
interconnectedness, and multi-scale existence, creating an environment that feels both alien
and grounded in recognizable biological and ecological patterns.

The setting embraces a naturalist's indifference to suffering and beauty alike. Wonders and
horrors exist not in balance but in whatever proportion they happen to occur. A
void-swimmer's migration song might guide travelers for generations, then cease without
warning when the creature dies, stranding countless souls. A planet-being's yawn might
create a breathable atmosphere; its sneeze might strip one away. These are not morality
tales. They simply are.

The documentary approach extends beyond natural phenomena to encompass the struggles
of civilizations attempting to survive within indifferent systems. Historical records catalog
reasonable decisions that led to catastrophe, brilliant solutions that created worse problems,
and lucky accidents misremembered as wisdom. Leaders face impossible choices with
incomplete information: evacuate before confirming danger or wait and risk annihilation;
maintain critical symbiotic relationships despite generational damage or sever them and
accept immediate collapse. The archives overflow with voting records of councils who chose
wrong despite choosing well.

The setting emphasizes discovery through observation, where phenomena are described as
they might be recorded by field researchers, complete with uncertainties, conflicting theories,
and ongoing discoveries. What appears to be understood often reveals deeper layers of
complexity upon further investigation. A thriving trade route becomes a death trap when
someone discovers the guiding plants were one organism entering dormancy. A stable
alliance collapses when both societies realize their bonding practices are biochemically
incompatible. Knowledge itself becomes a source of both salvation and doom.

The tone invites players to find meaning not in conquering or fixing the universe but in
observing, documenting, and navigating it. Beauty exists—genuinely, purely—but not for
anyone's comfort. Horror exists—viscerally, truly—but not as punishment. Most things exist
in the vast space between, neither beautiful nor horrible but simply present, waiting to be
observed, documented, and survived.

### The Planetary Garden: Cosmological Structure


The universe consists of innumerable small planetary bodies suspended in what scholars
call the Aether—a medium that permits the passage of light and life but remains poorly
understood. These planets range from tiny garden-sized spheres barely capable of
supporting a single family to larger bodies that might hold entire civilizations. Rather than
orbiting distant suns, these worlds are illuminated by much smaller, closer stellar objects that
orbit the planets themselves, creating complex and varied day-night cycles that differ
dramatically between worlds.

Gravity varies significantly between planets, with some exhibiting forces so light that visitors
can leap into orbit, while others possess crushing gravitational fields that compress visitors
to a fraction of their normal height. This gravitational diversity has produced extraordinary
biological variation, with each planet evolving life suited to its particular conditions. Some
creatures have grown large enough to completely engulf their small worlds, turning entire
planets into living organisms where the distinction between geology and biology becomes
meaningless.

The arrangement of planets appears random to casual observation, but long-term studies
suggest patterns that remain just beyond current understanding. Some clusters of planets
maintain relatively stable positions, while others drift through the Aether in patterns that
some scholars claim are migratory rather than orbital. The true nature of planetary
movement remains one of the great mysteries, spawning countless religious and
philosophical interpretations.

### Botanical Bridges: Inter-Planetary Travel

The most remarkable adaptation in this universe belongs to the plant kingdom, which has
evolved multiple methods of overcoming or circumventing gravity—an ability that appears
intrinsically linked to photosynthetic processes. This unique capability has made plants the
primary means of travel between worlds, fundamentally shaping the development of
inter-planetary civilization.

Various plant species employ different mechanisms for traversing the void:

```
● Bridge Vines grow between nearby planets, creating permanent connections that
may take generations to fully establish but provide stable pathways once mature
● Drift Flowers release seed pods that float on poorly understood Aetheric currents,
carrying passengers who can survive inside their protective shells
● Launcher Trees build pressure in specialized chambers before explosively
propelling seed pods—and willing passengers—toward neighboring worlds
● Void Swimmers actively propel themselves through space using unknown biological
processes, functioning as living vessels
```
Animal life, unable to replicate these gravity-defying abilities, has evolved elaborate
symbiotic relationships with traveling plants. Some species have become specialized
passengers, offering benefits like defense, nutrient processing, or navigation assistance in
exchange for transportation. Others cultivate travel-plants carefully, creating living
infrastructure that connects their communities across multiple worlds.


The mechanisms behind plant-based gravity defiance remain incompletely understood.
Current theories suggest a connection to photosynthesis that allows plants to convert light
into more than just chemical energy, possibly interacting with fundamental forces in ways
that animal life cannot replicate. This has led to extensive cultivation programs and careful
study of travel-plants, though attempts to replicate their abilities through purely technological
means have consistently failed.

### The Flux: Universal Rhythm

While each planet maintains its own local environmental patterns, all worlds experience a
phenomenon known as "The Flux"—a rhythm of change that affects atmospheric pressure,
gravitational stability, biological activity, and what practitioners call "arcane density." Each
planet's Flux cycle operates independently, typically completing over periods ranging from
three to twenty local days, though some extreme outliers have been documented.

The Flux phases—Calm, Rise, Peak, and Fall—manifest differently on each world but follow
recognizable patterns:

```
● Calm phases provide stable conditions optimal for most activities
● Rise sees increasing energy and biological activity, with many organisms entering
reproductive or growth phases
● Peak brings extreme conditions that vary by planet—gravitational fluctuations,
atmospheric density changes, or surges in symbiotic activity
● Fall represents a sometimes violent return to baseline, often accompanied by storms
or ecological turnover
```
Recent observations suggest that planetary Flux cycles, while independent, are somehow
interconnected. Certain planets consistently enter complementary phases, creating
temporary windows of stability for inter-planetary travel. Other combinations produce
amplification effects, where the Peak phase of one world seems to trigger or intensify the
Flux of its neighbors. These patterns have proven invaluable for navigation and timing of
journeys, though their underlying cause remains mysterious.

The Flux profoundly influences magical practice, with different phases affecting the behavior
of arcane syllables and the stability of spell constructs.

### Multi-Scale Ecosystem

The varied gravitational fields and planetary sizes have produced an ecosystem of
extraordinary scale diversity. On low-gravity worlds, gossamer beings stretch across
kilometers, their bodies too delicate to survive elsewhere. High-gravity planets produce
dense, compact life forms of incredible strength. Most remarkably, some organisms have
grown to encompass entire planets, blurring the distinction between creature and world.

These planet-encompassing beings present profound challenges to understanding. Are they
conscious? Do the civilizations living on their surfaces constitute parasites, symbionts, or
simply unnoticed inhabitants? Some planets thought to be geological have revealed


themselves to be dormant organisms, while others assumed to be living have proven to be
elaborate mineral formations created by long-extinct life.

The scale differentials create complex ecological relationships. What appears as weather to
smaller beings might be the breathing of a continental organism. Migrations of mega-fauna
can reshape planetary surfaces, forcing smaller species to adapt or relocate. Some
sophisticated civilizations have developed methods of communicating across scale barriers,
though such interactions remain difficult and often dangerous.

This multi-scale reality has profound implications for navigation and exploration. Travelers
might not realize they've landed on a living being until they notice patterns in what they
assumed was terrain. Some planets that appear dead from afar reveal themselves to be
teeming with microscopic civilizations upon closer inspection. The documentary approach to
understanding these scales means that even well-traveled routes may hide surprises for
those who observe carefully.

### Symbiotic Foundation

Survival in this universe depends fundamentally on symbiotic relationships. The inability of
animal life to independently traverse space has created elaborate inter-species partnerships
that define all aspects of technology and society. These relationships range from simple
biological mutualisms to complex cultivated partnerships developed over generations.

Technology emerges primarily from biological sources and symbiotic cooperation:

```
● Living Tools grown from specially cultivated organisms that respond to their
handler's needs
● Architectural Symbionts that construct and maintain buildings in exchange for
nutrients and care
● Atmospheric Processors that enable survival in void spaces or hostile
environments
● Navigation Specialists that sense routes between worlds through various biological
mechanisms
```
Different societies have developed distinct approaches to symbiosis. Some maintain rigid
hierarchies based on the rarity and power of an individual's symbiotic partners. Others
operate as collective organisms where the boundaries between species become increasingly
blurred over time. Professional specialization often revolves around maintaining relationships
with particular species or developing new forms of cooperation.

The sophistication of symbiotic relationships varies dramatically. Rural communities might
depend on a few essential partnerships, while advanced civilizations orchestrate
symphonies of inter-species cooperation. The loss of key symbiotic species can doom entire
settlements, making the protection and cultivation of partner organisms a primary concern
for most societies.

### The Taboo of Fire


Fire represents the fundamental taboo across nearly all known civilizations, though the full
complexity of reasons has been culturally flattened into simple prohibition over generations.
Children learn that fire brings disaster before they understand why, and most adults couldn't
articulate all the underlying causes—they simply know it is forbidden, dangerous, and
morally wrong.

The taboo stems from multiple overlapping truths, each sufficient to justify the prohibition:

###### The Anti-Symbiotic Nature

Fire represents pure consumption without reciprocity—it takes and gives nothing back. In a
universe built entirely on mutual dependence and symbiotic exchange, fire is philosophically
abhorrent, a form of existence that violates the fundamental compact holding all society
together. Those who use fire often find themselves unable to form the deep symbiotic bonds
necessary for survival, as partner organisms instinctively recoil from the scent of burning.

###### Syllabic Disruption

Fire creates catastrophic interference in the syllabic patterns that enable magic. Like static
corrupting a signal, flame generates noise that can shatter carefully maintained spell-poems,
releasing syllables in dangerous and unpredictable ways. Areas where fire has burned
become magical dead zones or, worse, chaotic zones where syllables behave erratically.
The corruption particularly affects Pyr, the syllable of warmth and glow—true fire might be
what happens when Pyr escapes control entirely.

###### Aetheric Combustion

The Aether itself—the medium between worlds—has varying density and composition.
Under certain conditions, particularly during specific Flux phases or in dense pockets, the
Aether becomes volatile. A small flame can cascade into a conflagration that consumes the
very atmosphere between worlds, destroying breathable air along travel routes and leaving
nothing but deadly void. These conditions are nearly impossible to predict, making any use
of fire a potentially catastrophic gamble.

###### Living World Reactions

Some planet-beings experience fire as pain—burning on their surface like acid on skin.
Others remain indifferent, but determining which response a world will have before lighting a
flame risks triggering anything from mild discomfort to violent convulsions that destroy
settlements. Documented cases exist of entire civilizations being expelled from their worlds
after accidentally causing their planet-being pain through fire use.

###### Historical Catastrophes

The legends speak consistently of fire-born disasters, though details vary by culture. The
Severing of the Garden Worlds, where burning vine-bridges sent a dozen connected planets
drifting apart into the void. The Wake of Ashfall, when a single cookfire allegedly roused a
dormant planet-being to destructive consciousness. The Syllabic Plague, where


fire-corrupted magic spread between worlds like infection. Whether these events happened
as described matters less than their cultural impact.

###### Technological Adaptation

This multi-layered taboo has shaped technological development profoundly. Metalworking
relies on chemical reactions, pressure, or symbiotic organisms that can reshape minerals.
Light comes from bioluminescent organisms, captured stellar radiation, or carefully
contained Pyr syllables. Cooking uses fermentation, chemical processes, or specialized
symbiotic organisms that break down food at the molecular level. Some societies have
forgotten fire entirely, while others maintain knowledge of it as a dire warning.

Different cultures emphasize different aspects of the taboo—some focus on the moral
violation of symbiosis, others on practical dangers, still others on religious implications—but
all agree on the prohibition itself. This creates a universal understanding across otherwise
diverse civilizations: fire is not merely dangerous but fundamentally wrong.

### Magic: The Syllabic Arts

Magic operates through the manipulation of fundamental sound-patterns called
syllables—vibrational constructs that can reshape reality when properly arranged.
Practitioners, known as Weavers or Poets depending on their tradition, create temporary
spell-patterns by combining these syllables into interpretive poems whose effects depend on
both composition and local conditions.

###### Planetary Influences

Some planets amplify certain syllables—water worlds strengthen Mhir, while dense planets
enhance Durn. Void spaces between worlds may cause syllables to leak from poorly
contained spells. These abundances also often indicate the ability to find more and powerful
embodiments of the syllable.

### Player Character Framework: Mind-Body Symbiosis

Player characters belong to a species created by symbiotic bonding. The collective term for
the two individual species plus the bonded form is Vostrani. See the section on them for all
the details.

### The Ambiguity of Divinity

In a universe where planets can be conscious and continent-sized beings reshape worlds
through their daily activities, the distinction between deity and creature becomes
meaninglessly blurred. This fundamental ambiguity shapes all religious and philosophical
thought, creating a cosmos where gods might be verifiably real while simultaneously being
nothing more than very large, very old organisms operating on incomprehensible scales.


###### Living Gods and Divine Creatures

Many beings worshipped as deities are demonstrably real and occasionally responsive.
Planet-beings that react to rituals performed on their surfaces, void-swimmers that seem to
shepherd travelers along specific routes, and massive entities that appear to cultivate
gardens of worlds all exist and can be observed. Yet their divinity remains a matter of
interpretation:

```
● A planet-being responding to prayers might simply be reacting to physical stimuli, like
a dog scratching an itch
● The "divine providence" that saves a settlement could be pure coincidence—they
happened to benefit from a larger being's metabolic process
● Sacred texts describing gods walking between worlds might be historical accounts of
observable mega-fauna migrations
```
This creates a spectrum of theological positions. Literalists maintain that power and scale
equal divinity. Naturalists argue everything is simply biology at different scales. Mystics claim
the distinction itself is false—divinity and biology are one. Each position can point to
evidence, and none can be definitively disproven.

###### Wars of Gods and Scale

Conflicts between massive entities create events that smaller beings invariably interpret
through religious frameworks. When two planet-beings compete for resources, entire
civilizations experience divine judgment. When void-dwelling mega-predators hunt, worlds
experience apocalypse. These events shape religious narratives for generations:

```
● The "Sundering of the Twin Worlds" (two planets colliding) becomes a cautionary tale
about divine wrath
● The "Season of Wandering" (gravitational disruption from a passing giant) transforms
into an exodus myth
● The "Blessed Symbiosis" (successful merger of two planet-beings) becomes a
sacred marriage narrative
```
What makes these interpretations particularly complex is that the entities involved might
actually be aware of and responding to worship, even if their understanding of it differs
completely from their worshippers' intentions. A planet-being might preserve certain areas
because it enjoys the sensation of rituals performed there, without any comprehension of the
theological significance its worshippers attach to this preservation.

###### Theological Conflicts and Evidence

Religious disputes take on new dimensions when gods might literally exist but their nature
remains uncertain:

```
● Incarnationists believe they've identified which specific beings embody their deities
and organize pilgrimages to make contact
● Abstractionists maintain that true divinity transcends physical beings, which are
merely vessels or shadows
```

```
● Pantheists argue the entire connected system of worlds and Flux represents a
singular divine entity
● Atheists insist that no matter how large or powerful, a biological entity cannot be
truly divine
```
These positions create practical conflicts. If a religion identifies a specific void-swimmer as
their deity, should trade routes be redirected to avoid disturbing it? If a planet is deemed
sacred, can its resources be harvested? When two planet-beings conflict, which side
represents divine will?

###### Practical Divinity

The observable existence of immensely powerful beings creates unique religious practices:

```
● Empirical Theology : Priests who study behavioral patterns of supposed deities to
predict their actions
● Diplomatic Prayer : Attempts to establish actual communication with verified divine
entities
● Evolutionary Worship : Religions that openly acknowledge their gods as biological
entities but maintain this doesn't diminish their divinity
● Reciprocal Faiths : Belief systems based on genuine symbiotic relationships with
massive entities
```
Some societies have developed sophisticated protocols for interacting with beings of
ambiguous divinity. They might perform rituals that definitely please a planet-being while
debating whether they're worshipping a god or simply maintaining good relations with their
living environment.

### Cultural and Religious Diversity

The impossible astronomy and mysterious connections between worlds have spawned
countless belief systems, each attempting to explain the nature of existence:

###### Competing Cosmologies

Different cultures offer wildly varying explanations for observable phenomena:

```
● The Gardeners believe the universe is a vast cultivation project by incomprehensible
beings
● The Dreamers claim all planets are thoughts in the mind of a sleeping god
● The Cyclists see the Flux as evidence of universal metabolism
● The Seeders maintain that planets are eggs that will eventually hatch
● The Weavers interpret the inter-planetary connections as a vast web of
consciousness
```
###### Pilgrimage and Sacred Worlds


Certain planets have acquired religious significance, becoming destinations for pilgrims
seeking enlightenment, healing, or communion with supposed divine forces. Some worlds
are considered sacred to specific deities, while others are quarantined as cursed or
dangerous to the spiritual order. The difficulty of reaching certain planets only adds to their
mystique.

###### Navigation as Divine Interpretation

The various methods of inter-planetary navigation often carry religious significance. Reading
plant-growth patterns becomes a form of divination. The songs of navigation creatures are
interpreted as divine hymns. Even practical travel takes on ritual significance when crossing
between worlds dedicated to different deities.

### Gameplay and Narrative Implications

This setting supports multiple layers of discovery and revelation:

###### The Unfolding Universe

Campaigns can begin on isolated worlds where inter-planetary travel is forgotten or
mythological. Early adventures involve local mysteries that later reveal themselves as
symptoms of larger cosmic patterns. That seasonal migration of walking mountains? They're
following gravitational tides between planets. Those ancient root systems that lead
nowhere? They're dormant travel-plants waiting for proper activation.

###### Progressive Understanding

As characters explore, they uncover deeper truths:

1. Initial discovery that other worlds exist
2. Recognition that the Flux connects across planets
3. Understanding that some planets are living beings
4. Realization that observed patterns suggest even larger organizations
5. Confrontation with the possibility that their entire universe might itself be a living
    system

###### Dynamic Challenges

The combination of independent Flux cycles, multi-scale ecosystems, and living planets
ensures that no location remains static. Today's safe harbor might be tomorrow's predator.
Established trade routes can become impassable when symbiotic plants enter dormancy.
The documentary approach means that even experienced travelers can encounter surprises.

###### Cultural Navigation

Different societies' approaches to navigation, symbiosis, and magic create natural conflicts
and opportunities for cooperation. A party might need to negotiate with multiple cultures to


gather the diverse skills needed for a complex journey. Understanding local interpretations of
magic and symbiosis becomes as important as combat prowess.

This setting encourages collaborative world-building where players contribute to the
understanding and development of the universe through their characters' observations and
experiences, making each campaign a shared exploration rather than a predetermined story.
The documentary tone ensures that there's always another layer to discover, another
perspective to consider, and another mystery to investigate.

### Setting Title Reference

###### The Name Itself

**Thren**

```
● What the inhabitants call their cosmos
● Ancient, fundamental word worn smooth by millennia of use
● Every child knows this word before they can walk
● Possibly once much longer, eroded down to its essential syllable
● Encompasses everything: the worlds, the void between, the connections, the living
planets, all of it
```
**The Aethermere**

```
● The outsider's attempt to translate/understand Thren
● Suggests both "Aether" (the medium between worlds) and "mere" (sea/lake)
● Also carries "merely" - this vast everything that might be merely something else's
droplet
● The elaborate phrase needed to approximate what they capture in one syllable
```
###### The Structure

**"Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds"**

```
● Poetic, sprawling, trying to capture something ineffable
● Evokes the image of space itself becoming dense with planetary bodies
● Suggests organic growth rather than mechanical placement
```
**"A Crude Rendering"**

```
● Admits the violence done to the concept in translation
● More honest than "imperfect" or "incomplete"
● Suggests both linguistic translation and artistic sketch
```
###### Tonal Purpose

The unwieldy length becomes a feature:


```
● Players will naturally shorten it differently
● Suggests the impossibility of capturing the totality
● Documentary feel of observers who keep discovering they understood less than they
thought
● Bold, poetic, slightly tragic rather than humorous
● Sets expectation that this is observed from outside, never fully understood
```
###### Practical Usage

```
● Full formal title : Where the Aethermere Grows Thick With Worlds: A Crude
Rendering of Thren
● Common abbreviations players might use : "Thren," "The Aethermere," "Thick
With Worlds"
● In-world scholarly references : Might cite it as "Crude Rendering" or "the Thren
documentation"
```
