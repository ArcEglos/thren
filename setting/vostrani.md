## Vostrani

### Overview

The dominant sapient species of the Symbiotic Realms exists in three distinct forms:
unbonded Bodies, unbonded Minds, and bonded pairs. This triadic society represents one of
the universe's most complex social organisms, where conscious choice determines whether
individuals remain in their birth state or merge with another to become something
fundamentally new. The species embodies the world's central theme of symbiosis not
through necessity but through opportunity—each state being complete yet limited, functional
yet yearning for the possibilities that union brings.

### The Three States of Being

###### Unbonded Bodies

Bodies are fully functional sapient beings who experience the world through immediacy and
action. Standing humanoids, their skin ranges across earth tones and deeper hues, often
marked with natural patterns that identify family lineages.

Bodies possess practical intelligence focused on the immediate and tangible. They excel at
crafts, construction, agriculture, and all forms of physical labor. Their memory spans weeks
rather than years, making them masters of routine and practice but struggling with long-term
planning or abstract reasoning. They experience emotions deeply but simply—joy, sadness,
anger, and love uncomplicated by overthinking or anxiety about the future.

Their communities value action, tradition, and the rhythm of daily life. Without Minds, Bodies
cannot perceive or manipulate syllabic magic, nor can they grasp complex mathematics or
philosophical concepts. Yet they build, farm, craft, and maintain the physical infrastructure
that allows civilization to exist. They speak in simple languages focused on the concrete and
present, rich in words for textures, movements, and immediate sensations but lacking terms
for abstract concepts or future conditionals.

###### Unbonded Minds

Minds exist as smaller creatures, roughly the size of a housecat, with skin resembling
smooth leather or tree bark—never furry, but textured in ways that provide grip and
protection. Their most prominent features are large, complex eyes capable of perceiving
multiple light spectra, and a body designed for clinging and climbing with six delicate limbs.
Along one side of their body run smooth, warm contact surfaces—areas where neural
connection with a Body can occur.

Without Bodies, Minds depend on communal symbiosis for survival. Mind colonies often
attach themselves to Body settlements, providing planning and problem-solving in exchange
for protection and resources. They might orchestrate crop rotations the Bodies follow by


tradition, or design building improvements the Bodies construct without understanding the
underlying principles. Some Minds partner temporarily with animals or plants for mobility and
manipulation. Others "ride along" with bonded pairs as observers and advisors, experiencing
the world secondhand while contributing their thoughts and perceptions.

Minds perceive patterns, connections, and abstractions that Bodies cannot grasp. They
understand the flow of syllabic energy, the mathematical relationships between phenomena,
and the long chains of cause and effect that shape the future. Yet without Bodies, they
struggle with emotional regulation, physical causality, and the immediate consequences of
actions. They can plan elaborate schemes but not understand why hunger hurts. They can
compose symphonies in their thoughts but not comprehend the physical joy of dancing.

###### Bonded Pairs

When a Mind and Body choose to bond—typically during adolescence though sometimes
later—they create something neither could achieve alone. The bonding process takes
several days of gradual synchronization as neural pathways align and consciousness
merges. The Mind positions itself asymmetrically along one shoulder and arm, its contact
surfaces interfacing with corresponding points along the Body's shoulder blade and upper
arm. This creates the distinctive lopsided silhouette that marks bonded individuals.

The bonded consciousness experiences both immediate reality and abstract patterns
simultaneously. They can feel the joy of movement while understanding the physics behind
it. They perceive syllabic energy and manipulate it through combined will and action.
Memory extends from the Body's present-focused experience to encompass years of the
Mind's accumulated knowledge, though early memories from before bonding often feel
dreamlike and disconnected.

The asymmetric bond creates functional differentiation: the "Mind side" gains enhanced
sensitivity and magical manipulation, while the "Body side" retains full native strength and
proprioception. This often influences tool use and combat styles, with the Mind side handling
delicate work while the Body side provides power and stability.

Bonded pairs often serve as bridges between the two unbonded communities, translating
abstract plans into concrete actions, or explaining physical necessities in terms of long-term
consequences. They alone can work complex magic, combining the Mind's perception of
syllables with the Body's ability to ground and channel the energy.

### Daily Life of the Bonded

**The Unity of Self**

A bonded Sethrem is not two beings in cooperation—they are one person whose biology
spans two original forms. The neural bonding creates unified consciousness as surely as
your left and right hemispheres create your singular self. The Mind and Body are not
"partners" or "rider and mount" but aspects of one integrated organism. This distinction
matters: the alienness of Sethrem isn't in how they think about themselves, but in how they
came to be.


**Nutrition and Metabolism**

The Body handles bulk caloric intake through standard humanoid eating. Through the neural
interface, most nutrients transfer directly to the Mind, making separate feeding unnecessary.
However, the Mind's metabolism occasionally requires specific compounds—trace minerals,
certain proteins—that the Body's diet doesn't prioritize. Most Sethrem households keep
small supplies of the Mind's preferred supplements: copper-rich beetles, phosphorus-heavy
nuts, or mineral pastes applied directly to the Mind's mouth. This isn't "feeding the Mind
separately" but ensuring the whole self gets what it needs—no different than a human taking
iron supplements.

**Sleep and Awareness**

Consciousness sleeps as one. The Mind doesn't maintain a separate sleep cycle or remain
awake while the Body rests. The shared sleep means dreams blend both perspective types:
spatial-immediate imagery from the Body's processing, pattern-abstract imagery from the
Mind's. Sethrem often report dreams that feel simultaneously like running through a forest
and understanding the mathematical relationships between the trees.

**Speech and Expression**

Bonded pairs speak with unified intent through the Body's voice. The Mind's vocal
apparatus—smaller, more precise—typically adds emotional coloring: agreement chirps,
skeptical sounds, warning trills that layer over spoken words like human tonal variation. This
creates rich vocal expression that outsiders sometimes find difficult to read.

In specific contexts, pairs can deliberately split into two simultaneous voices—addressing
mixed Torrnek/Kemerin audiences, or expressing genuine internal conflict. This dual-voice is
unusual enough to draw attention and is considered either impressive or unsettling
depending on cultural context.

**Movement and Proprioception**

The bonding process creates shared body-awareness across both forms. During bonding,
four of the Mind's six limbs wrap around the Body's shoulder and upper arm, their delicate
grip becoming the physical anchoring while their inner surfaces form the neural interface
points. These limbs remain permanently positioned—not paralyzed, but integrated into the
junction structure itself.

The Mind's remaining two limbs stay free, extending from the bonded mass with full mobility.
Though shorter and weaker than the Body's arms, they offer remarkable fine motor
control—perfect for delicate manipulation, precision work, or gestural emphasis.
Proprioception extends seamlessly across all four limbs (two Body, two Mind), coordinating
without conscious effort.

This unified proprioception explains why bond-breaking is so traumatic. Losing the bond isn't
like losing a partner—it's like losing limbs, senses, and memories simultaneously. The
remaining self is genuinely incomplete in ways that go beyond emotional loss.


The visual result is distinctive: the Mind's body conforming to the shoulder with four limbs
wrapped in permanent embrace, two smaller arms extending forward, and the Mind's head
positioned over the shoulder providing a second viewpoint. The "leaning ones" silhouette
that gave them their taxonomical name.

**Junction Maintenance**

The neural interface points require regular care, similar to wound maintenance or caring for
sensitive skin. Specialized oils keep the connection healthy, preventing inflammation or
infection. Most cultures produce these oils locally, and junction-care is simply part of daily
hygiene—no more remarkable than brushing teeth or cleaning ears.

The junction can become strained through overexertion, creating localized pain that affects
both sides of the bond. Bone-setters and healers who specialize in junction care exist in
most settlements of any size.

### The Bonding Choice

Coming-of-age bonding represents one of the most significant decisions in an individual's
life. Unlike the historical necessity of infant bonding in ancient times, modern society allows
Bodies and Minds to mature independently before choosing whether to merge.

Different cultures approach bonding differently. Some hold elaborate festivals where young
Minds and Bodies meet and test compatibility through shared tasks and conversations.
Others use careful matchmaking based on complementary traits and family histories. Still
others believe in spontaneous bonding—that Minds and Bodies will recognize their ideal
partners instinctively.

The choice to bond is irreversible under normal circumstances. The gradual neural fusion
permanently alters both beings' consciousness patterns. Some individuals choose never to
bond, remaining in their birth state throughout their lives. These "eternally unbonded" may
be viewed with respect, pity, or suspicion depending on cultural context.

Compatibility varies widely. Some pairings produce harmonious unions where both aspects
blend seamlessly. Others result in internal tension, with the Mind and Body aspects of the
bonded pair pulling in different directions. The most successful bonds often occur between
individuals who knew each other before bonding and chose union from a place of mutual
understanding rather than societal pressure.

### Player Character Background: The Bond-Broken

Player characters represent a rare and traumatic category: those who have been forcibly
separated and emergency re-bonded with their original partner. This violent disruption and
reconstitution explains both their "newness" to the world and their potential for growth and
change.

###### The Traumatic Separation


Various catastrophes can forcibly sever a bond:

```
● Exposure to corrupted syllabic energy that disrupts neural connections
● Rare toxins or diseases that target the bonding interface
● Extreme physical trauma that damages the neural connection points
● Poorly executed magical experiments or failed attempts at grand magic
```
The separation is agonizing. The Mind experiences sensory deprivation and cognitive
dissolution as abstract thought becomes impossible without the Body's grounding. The Body
suffers immediate memory loss, retaining only the past few weeks while losing all context for
their actions and relationships. Both halves recognize each other but cannot fully remember
who they were together.

###### Emergency Re-bonding

Re-bonding must occur within days or both halves will die. The process is rushed,
desperate, and imperfect. Instead of the gradual synchronization of first bonding, the neural
pathways forge new connections wherever they can, creating a similar but fundamentally
altered consciousness.

The new bond forms different patterns than the original. Skills once second nature now feel
foreign. Most memories are lost. Some memories survive, but feel like watching another
person's life. The personality remains fundamentally the same but expressed differently.

###### Social Status

"Bond-broken" pairs occupy a unique social position. They're viewed with a mixture of
sympathy, curiosity, and unease. Some cultures see them as touched by fate, marked for
either greatness or tragedy. Others consider them fundamentally unreliable, their altered
bonds making them unpredictable.

The bond-broken often struggle with identity questions. Are they the same person they were
before? Do old relationships and obligations still apply? Most eventually accept that they are
both their old selves and someone new—a perspective that can be either liberating or deeply
unsettling.

### Physical Design

###### Visual Characteristics

**Bodies** are humanoid but with clear non-human features. Their skin has a subtle texture
reminiscent of tree bark or river stones, with natural patterns that are unique to individuals
but similar within family lines. The neural interface points appear as slightly raised areas
along one shoulder blade and upper arm, resembling natural armor plating or deliberate
scarification rather than ports or wounds.

**Minds** are compact creatures with six limbs designed for climbing and clinging. Their skin
has a leather-like or bark-like texture that provides grip without fur or scales. The large eyes


dominate their faces, capable of independent movement like a chameleon's. Along one side
of their body, the skin is smoother and warmer—the contact surface for bonding. When not
bonded, they move with quick, precise movements, using their multiple limbs to navigate
three-dimensional spaces with ease.

**Bonded pairs** have a distinctive asymmetric silhouette. The Mind wraps along one shoulder
and upper arm, its body conforming to the Body's musculature. The Mind's head extends
forward over that shoulder, providing a second viewpoint and expanded peripheral vision.
The bonded side appears bulkier but also more elaborate, often decorated with clothing or
armor that emphasizes rather than hides the union.

###### Cultural Variations

Different societies emphasize different aspects of the bond through decoration and
modification:

```
● Some paint elaborate patterns that flow from Body to Mind, emphasizing their unity
● Others use contrasting decorations to celebrate the distinct natures being joined
● Certain cultures practice scarification or tattooing that only makes sense when the
pair bonds
● Military groups might armor the bonded side heavily while keeping the Body side
mobile
```
### Societal Structures

###### Economic Specialization

The triadic nature of society creates natural economic specialization:

```
● Bodies dominate physical industries: construction, agriculture, crafts, transportation
● Minds excel in planning, design, theoretical work, and pattern analysis
● Bonded pairs bridge both worlds: architecture, complex engineering, magical
practices, leadership
```
This creates interdependence rather than hierarchy. A Body farmer needs Mind-designed
rotation patterns to maintain soil health. A Mind architect needs Body builders to realize their
designs. Bonded pairs coordinate between both groups, translating abstract plans into
practical action.

###### Political Systems

Governance varies widely between cultures:

```
● Some societies maintain three separate councils (Body, Mind, and Bonded) that must
reach consensus
● Others rotate leadership between the three states on regular cycles
● Certain cultures restrict political participation to bonded pairs, viewing them as the
only "complete" citizens
```

```
● A few radical societies are governed entirely by one state, though these tend toward
instability
```
###### Family Structures

Reproduction complicates social relationships. Bodies reproduce with Bodies, Minds with
Minds, but bonded pairs raise children of both species together. This creates extended
family networks where biological and bond relationships interweave:

```
● A bonded pair might raise their Body's biological offspring alongside their Mind's
● Unbonded relatives often help raise children of their own species
● Some cultures practice communal child-rearing where the entire community shares
responsibility
● Others maintain strict separation between Body and Mind children until bonding age
```
###### Religious and Philosophical Perspectives

The three states inspire diverse theological interpretations:

```
● Unificationists believe bonding represents divine intention, with unbonded beings
incomplete
● Trinitarian faiths celebrate all three states as equally sacred expressions of
existence
● Separatists view bonding as corruption of pure forms, advocating for remaining
unbonded
● Cyclic philosophies propose that souls experience all three states across multiple
lifetimes
```
### Gameplay Implications

###### Character Creation

Players create both halves of their bond-broken pair, choosing:

```
● The Body's physical variant (affecting stats and capabilities)
● The Mind's temperament (influencing mental abilities and magical affinity)
● Their original bond nature (how well-synchronized they were before breaking)
● The cause of their bond-breaking (affecting starting situation and contacts)
● Which shoulder the Mind bonds to (affecting handedness and combat style)
```
###### Mechanical Considerations

The asymmetric bond creates tactical choices:

```
● Mind-side actions gain bonuses to precision and magical manipulation
● Body-side actions gain bonuses to strength and durability
● Switching which hand holds a weapon or tool takes conscious effort
● Some abilities require both sides working in concert
```

###### Character Development

As bond-broken pairs adventure, they can:

```
● Recover fragments of their original memories through familiar experiences
● Develop new neural pathways that grant different abilities than their original bond
● Learn to communicate with unbonded members of both species
● Potentially help other bond-broken pairs with their own recovery
```
The trauma of breaking and re-bonding means character growth represents not just gaining
power but rediscovering and redefining identity—a journey that parallels the player's growing
understanding of the game world itself.

### The Vostrani: Complete Naming Reference

###### Species Overview

**VOSTRANI**

```
● The taxonomical name used by outsiders

###### Cultural Usage Notes

```
● The Vostrani themselves primarily use their specific form names or cultural/national
identities
● Using "Vostrani" within their communities varies:

○ Traditionalists may see it as outsider ignorance
○ Diplomatic contexts use it for inter-species clarity
● Scholarly texts often use both: "The Vostrani (collectively known) comprise three
forms: the Torrnek..."
● The term "Vostrani" immediately reveals the speaker as an outsider or someone
engaged in inter-species dialogue
```

perspective)
● Torrnek/Kemerin/Sethrem
○ what they call themselves (showing cultural knowledge)
● Qemerin vs Kemerin
○ indicates social class or educational background
● Torn
○ rough slang for bond-broken, potentially offensive depending on context
