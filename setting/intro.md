**_The Vertebrae Steps_**

Old Geth breathes, and the market breathes with it—awnings unfurling with each honeyed
exhale, collapsing with the mulch-thick inhale. Three generations of traders learning the
city-creature's rhythm, dancing to it. You pass Torrnek workers sorting pods into Old Geth’s
feeding mouths with practiced devotion, pretending not to notice what everyone sees:
Kelitch's Garden dying in the sky above. Yesterday's forests now consumed by black
growths like fungus, creeping ever closer to the bridge-vine's root.

Geth’s ancient flesh flinches beneath you. You steady yourself, catching a trader's eye—her
face confirming what your soles already know. Far below, in cavities never walked, Geth's
oldest tendons - wrapping this barren world since memory began - are loosening from
stone..
