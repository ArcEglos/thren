# Items & Equipment

## Companion

You and the group have a shared companion creature. It carries your effects while you're on the road, functioning as your inventory.

It has a maximum amount of things it can carry and can take Strain, too. It may also have capabilities that influence how it can move, how much it can carry, and what its needs are.

Generally these creatures are just intelligent enough to follow simple instructions such as waiting on the group somewhere, helping to watch out for danger, or moving in specified ways.

The group can have multiple companions, but can only take one of them with you at a time.

## Equipment

Special equipment in Thren isn't manufactured—it's cultivated, befriended, or harvested from creatures.

**Basic equipment** without special properties - simple weapons, tools, armor - never degrade.

**Living equipment** - with special abilities/effects - has an active/dormant cycle. When dormant, it loses its special properties.

Example cycles:
- **Single Bloom**: "This void-swimmer spine can pierce any armor... once per season"
- **Flux Sensitive**: "These navigator moths only wake during Peak Flux"
- **Feed to Wake**: "The armor sleeps unless fed rare specimens"
- **Exhaustion Cycle**: "After three uses, needs a full season of rest"

## Item Structure

Items have:
- **Hex slots**: Spaces for tiles that define the item's magical properties
- **Ports**: Connection points where flow lines can safely exit
- **Flow groups**: The magical affinities the item works with (ember, growth, stone, tide, void)

Items must be **investigated** before use - a puzzle process of placing tiles to create stable flow line configurations.

## Wealth

The party shares a level of wealth. You can afford to buy anything that matches your level of wealth - assuming it is available.
