# Running the Game

## Tracks

Tracks represent extended challenges, ongoing situations, or gradual changes that require multiple actions to resolve. They create structured pacing for complex tasks while maintaining tension through visible progress (or deterioration).

### Basic Track Mechanics

**Creating a Track**
- GM determines length (typically 3-10 segments) based on complexity/severity
- Each segment represents meaningful progress or change
- Label endpoints and optionally key middle segments

**Advancing Tracks**
- Successes advance the track by 1 segment (or more for critical successes)
- Failures might add complications, lose progress, or advance a different track
- Multiple characters can contribute to the same track
- Different segments might require different skills

### Track Types

**Standard Tracks**

Progress from start to completion. Used for:
- Extended projects (crafting, research, construction)
- Journeys and travel
- World events progressing

**Dual-Sided Tracks**

Progress fills from both ends toward the middle. The track advances from the left (worsening), while successes fill segments from the right (preventing the worst outcomes). Once the advancing threat meets the filled prevention, further successes reverse the track leftward.

Used for:
- Deteriorating situations (poison, disease, structural collapse)
- Rising threats (mob anger, approaching storm, ritual completion)
- Competitive races (who reaches the goal - in the middle - first)

This creates dramatic situations where early intervention prevents disaster, but the threat still worsens before improving.

### Track Variations

- **Branching Points**: Some tracks split based on approach or outcomes
- **Clock Tracks**: Advance automatically each scene/rest/day
- **Hidden Tracks**: Players see effects but not the track itself (or only the steps, but not the labels)

## Running Action Scenes

During an action scene, whenever the momentum swings to the GM, they can spotlight an NPC or Foe they control and have it take a Turn similar to a player action.

Afterwards, they can either give back the Momentum to the Players, or spend a Fear to Spotlight another NPC or Foe. They can continue spending Fear until they don't have any left.

## Titan Combat: The Telegraph Pattern

Large entities—whether planet-beings, void-swimmers, or ancient colossi—operate on different time scales than normal creatures. Their attacks are powerful but telegraphed, creating tactical puzzles rather than reflex challenges. Players must observe, interpret, and respond to warning signs rather than simply trading blows.

### Turn Structure

When running massive entities, offset their actions:

1. **Resolve** the previously telegraphed action
   - "The geysers erupt where the cracks appeared last turn"
   - Apply consequences to anyone who didn't respond

2. **Telegraph** the next action with clear signs
   - "The creature's throat sac begins glowing, pulsing with increasing intensity"
   - "Gravity shifts—small rocks start falling upward toward its maw"
   - "Its thousand eyes all focus on a single point"

3. **Players act** with full knowledge of what's coming
   - Can attempt to disrupt the telegraph
   - Can move to safety
   - Can exploit the creature's committed action

### Telegraph Guidelines

**Make tells obvious**: This isn't about surprising players—**it's about forcing hard choices.** "Save the civilian or dodge the attack?" "Get a Hit in trying to interrupt or get to safety?"

**Different tells for different attacks:**
- Physical attacks: Ground cracks, muscles tense, weight shifts
- Energy attacks: Glowing, humming, temperature changes
- Summoning/calling: Songs, pheromones, vibrations
- Environmental: Weather shifts, gravity flux, time distortion

**Disruption possibilities**: Some telegraphs can be interrupted:
- Attacking the glowing throat sac
- Blocking the summoning call
- Destroying the focusing crystal
- Success might reduce or redirect the attack

### Scale and Positioning

Large entities often have **zones** rather than single positions. Movement between zones takes time, creating positioning puzzles.

- **Head/sensory zone** (where it perceives)
- **Limbs/appendages** (where it strikes)
- **Core/body** (where it's vulnerable)
- **Aura/influence** (environmental effects)

### Example Titan Turn

**The Dormant World-Seed** (a planet-being waking):

*Turn 1:*
- Resolves: (nothing—first turn)
- Telegraphs: Surface cracks appear in geometric patterns
- Players: Investigate, prepare, or flee

*Turn 2:*
- Resolves: Crystalline spines erupt from the cracks (damage + difficult terrain)
- Telegraphs: The spines begin resonating, building a harmonic frequency
- Players: Destroy spines, find shelter, or attempt communication

*Turn 3:*
- Resolves: Sonic pulse shatters anything crystalline (including equipment)
- Telegraphs: The ground becomes spongy, porous—something rising from beneath
- Players: Escape to solid ground, or prepare to ride whatever emerges
