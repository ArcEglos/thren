# Core Rules

## Welcome

You are a group of Sethrem. Each of you an individuum formed by a Kemerin and a Torrnek bonding.

This world is not kind. You are not invincible. Sometimes the only thing you can do is run.

## Duality

How the body-side - the Torrnek - and the mind-side - the Kemerin - are interacting is core to your character.

## Dice Pools

When asked to roll a Dicepool(n), roll n d6 and take the highest number:
- **6**: Full success
- **4-5**: Success with complication
- **1-3**: Failure

If n = 0, roll 2d6 and take the lowest. For n = -1 roll 3d6 take lowest, etc.

The GM can add situational modifiers to the dice pool.

### Momentum Die

One die in every pool has a different color - this is the momentum die. A result of 1-3 on this die shifts momentum.

## Observation

Everyone can observe, regardless of abilities. Roll Dicepool(2 - Strain + Collaborators).

Others can collaborate if they have relevant knowledge - each collaborator adds a die to the pool.

## Strain

You don't lose hitpoints, you accumulate Body Strain and Mind Strain. If you get overwhelmed you shut down or risk partial death.

### Accumulating Strain

**Voluntarily:** As the least bad option in bad situations, you can take strain to solve an immediate problem.

**Involuntarily:** Getting hurt, experiencing terrible things, or being exhausted can cause strain.

### Recovery

Clear two Strain on each Rest. Medical remedies and Abilities can clear additional Strain.

### Limits

Your default limit for both body and mind strain is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

When you hit the limit on the Strain of one side, you have two options:

1. **Shutdown** - The strained side shuts down
2. **Desperate Push** - Roll 1d6 immediately:
   - **1-3**: That side of the bond dies
   - **4-6**: Clear 4 Strain, continue functioning

### Shutdown

You're overwhelmed. Something inside you gives up. This will have lasting consequences.

**You take a Scar:** The Strain limit for the side shutting down is permanently reduced by 2. Work with the GM to define the scar narratively. Removing a scar is a major quest in itself.

**Effects:**
- **Body shutdown:** The Body becomes unresponsive while the Mind observes, terrified.
- **Mind shutdown:** The Mind goes catatonic while the Body continues, vaguely aware the party are friends.
- **Both sides shut down:** Complete catatonia.

## Adrenaline

The blood is pumping through your veins, you rolled your ankle and you didn't even notice.

### Hits

During dangerous scenes, the Body tracks physical damage as hits, separate from strain. Any hits you receive first consume your Guard, then accumulate. As long as you stay below your overwhelmed threshold you are not impaired. If you hit this threshold your adrenaline immediately crashes.

Your default overwhelmed threshold is 6. You can increase it with abilities.

### Crash

Once the dangerous scene is over - or you hit your overwhelm threshold - your adrenaline crashes. Your actions catch up to you:

- Every hit converts to 1 Body Strain
- Medical attention can reduce conversion

### Guard

You start with 1 Guard. Abilities and Equipment can increase your Guard. It replenishes once the dangerous scene is over.

## Momentum

In action scenes, momentum flows between GM and the players. It is determined by momentum checks depending on the action taken.

When a momentum check would fail, you can:

1. **Maintain control**
   - Take 2 Strain (Mind or Body, depending on action)
   - Keep momentum on your side

2. **Accept the shift.** The GM chooses ONE:
   - **Immediate Turn**: GM acts right after your action resolves
   - **Bank Fear Token**: Store for later escalation
   - **Complication**: Something in the scene gets worse for you

## Inadequacy

You have an inadequacy that impacts you and can ruin things in the worst moments. For example:

- **Regret**: You're haunted by something you did (or didn't) do
- **Recklessness**: Sometimes you ignore your - or others' - safety in pursuit of your goal
- **Fear**: If you think about it too much you get overwhelmed
- **Blame**: There's someone responsible for all the bad that's happened to you

When you act on your inadequacy in a way that causes complications, you clear one strain.

## Rest

Getting a full rest takes 8 hours. If you don't get a rest for more than 24h you're risking strain.

During rest:
- Clear 2 Strain
- Reorganize equipment and mental loadout
- Perform investigation rituals on items

## Character Creation

Pick 10 Abilities. Write your character profile and decide on your inadequacy. Pick if you're a youth, adult, or mature.
