# Base of Operations

A place to call home - not built but *cultivated*. Bases are typically massive sedentary organisms or grown structures that require care and feeding.

The party needs to be at least well-off to start a Base.

## Base Properties

**Size:** How many people it can shelter
- **Small**: The party
- **Medium**: Party + hirelings
- **Large**: Small community

**Capability examples** (gained through feeding/cultivation):
- **Storage**: Extended inventory space, specimen preservation
- **Defense**: Natural barriers, warning systems
- **Comfort**: Reduces strain recovery time
- **Workshop**: Enables complex crafting projects
- **Communications**: Connection to travel-plants or message systems
- **Concealment**: Hidden from casual observation

## Maintenance

Bases require regular attention:
- **Feeding**: Monthly specimen investment
- **Mood management**: For living bases, keeping them content
- **Repairs**: After attacks or flux events
- **Seasonal changes**: Some bases hibernate or migrate

Neglected bases might:
- Refuse entry
- Lose capabilities
- Attract unwanted inhabitants
- Wander off (if mobile)
- Die (becoming a different kind of shelter)

## Base Evolution

Bases can grow through:
- Regular feeding with quality specimens
- Successful symbiotic bonding
- Surviving significant events together
- Exposure to unusual Flux patterns

This growth is narrative, not mechanical—your base develops personality and quirks that create story opportunities rather than numerical bonuses.

## Starting a Base

When the party is interested:

1. Find suitable base organism/structure - work with the GM
2. Establish initial symbiosis - might require specific specimens
3. Name it
4. Choose two initial capabilities
5. Determine its feeding preferences
