# Flux

All planets have a flux cycle - impacting biology and magic alike. The cycles are different and yet connected. Working against the Flux is just as deadly as working with it is empowering.

## The Four Phases

### Calm
- The universe rests
- Systems operate predictably but with reduced energy
- The safest time, but also the least dynamic

### Rising
- The universe stirring to wakefulness
- Risk and reward both increase
- Hidden possibilities begin to emerge

### Peak
- Extreme effects dominate
- Impossible becomes possible
- Normal becomes dangerous

### Falling
- Systems break down unpredictably
- Chaos creates unexpected openings
- Desperation drives innovation
- The universe exhausting itself

## Tracking

Each world maintains its own Flux track, moving along the track every day.

- Typically 4-20 segments long
- Peak and Falling are usually a single segment
- Calm is often the longest phase

When cosmic events shake reality, the flux cycle can stall or slip. This is always telegraphed.

## Effects on Items and Magic

The flux influences item investigation and magical workings:

- **Calm**: Standard difficulty
- **Rising**: Slightly more generous results
- **Peak**: Powerful effects possible, but also more dangerous
- **Falling**: Unstable, degradation accelerated
