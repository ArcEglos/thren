# Circle of Life

## Passing of Time

At the end of a session, the table can decide that a Season or a Generation passes.

## Season

The ritual of a passing season reflects on what happened and how it influences the future.

### 1: The Telling

The table together narrates the remaining events of the season. The group gathers specimens and social connections as appropriate.

**You gain a new Ability. If it's the end of a year you also gain a new Skillpoint.**

### 2: The Reckoning

**Social Decay**
- Clean connections lose 1 point (minimum 0)
- Pressured connections lose 2 points (flip negative at 0)
- Dirty connections roll d6: 1-2 = exposed and flip negative
- Players narrate how neglected relationships withered

**Equipment Cycles**
- Dormant items check for reawakening
- Active items check for dormancy

**Base Seasonal Needs**
- Feeding requirement: 3-5 specimens of appropriate type
- Mood check: Roll d6
  - 1-2: Discontent (one capability dormant next season)
  - 3-4: Neutral (functions normally)
  - 5-6: Thriving (temporary bonus capability)
- If it's the end of a year: Add a capability
- Describe how the base has grown/changed

### 3: The Turning

At the beginning of the next session, the GM introduces how the world changed:
- The current state of the Flux
- Major NPC plans advance or conclude
- Political situations shift
- New opportunities or threats emerge
- Travel routes move
- Seasonal events begin (migrations, blooms, dormancies)

## Generation

**Social connections:** The table together narrates how the group's connections interact with the world at large, completely changing their social network.

**Skill progression:**
- You may swap out abilities to different ones you have learned in the intervening time
- You may redistribute 3 skill points (but cannot reduce anything below 1)

**Base evolution:** The table together narrates how the base interacts with the world at large and evolves over time, completely changing it.

### Aging

You age one bracket. Describe the physical changes. Your capabilities change with you:
- **Youth → Adult**: Gain 1 to any skill
- **Adult → Mature**: +1 Mind limit, -1 Body limit
- **Mature → Elder**: +1 to knowledge, -1 to all Body-involving skills, consider retirement

## Retirement

When characters reach narrative completion or become too scarred/aged:

**The Retirement Ceremony:**
1. Player narrates their character's final testimony
2. Character becomes NPC, remaining in the world
3. They might provide knowledge, shelter, or quests

## Death

You are broken. Half of you died, with you feeling every moment of it.

### Grief

Grieving takes time. You are playing as an unbonded Torrnek or Kemerin while you are grieving. Discuss with the GM how long it will last. Some Broken-bonded never bond again and choose retirement.

You lose all skills of the side that died. The remaining skills are reduced by one from the trauma. Adjust your character and inadequacy.

**Torrnek (body without mind):**
- Operates on habit and instinct
- Recognizes party as "safe" but may not remember why
- Can fight, build, and work but cannot strategize
- Must be given clear, simple directions
- May wander off if not watched

**Kemerin (mind without body):**
- Requires care from party (food, warmth, safety)
- Physically helpless (size of a housecat)
- Can cling to party members for transport
- Can observe, speak, and advise

### Rebonding

When rebonding after grief, distribute 3 skill points across any Skills.

Your new bond partner brings their own background and connections - adjust name, character and inadequacy.
